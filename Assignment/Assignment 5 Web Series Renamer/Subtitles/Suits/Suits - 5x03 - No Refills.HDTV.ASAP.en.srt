1
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:03,043
You took a case
on contingency

2
00:00:03,078 --> 00:00:05,078
where every plaintiff
is dirt poor.

3
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:06,046
Dump it.

4
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:07,747
One of the victims
was my uncle Keith.

5
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:09,683
Please, these people
need your help.

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,818
They need someone like you
to fight for them,

7
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:13,353
and I can't do it.

8
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,055
Then what do you say
we do it together?

9
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,222
I'd like to propose a change

10
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:18,124
to the current
compensation formula.

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,592
How many partners
do you have in your pocket

12
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:20,794
if we put your proposal
to a vote?

13
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:22,262
I can get 45%.

14
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:23,430
I'm gonna get you
the difference.

15
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:25,265
This is Harvey's
last three income statements,

16
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,900
and I found them sitting
in the copy machine.

17
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:28,168
You came to work for me,

18
00:00:28,203 --> 00:00:29,469
so now it's time
for you to decide.

19
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:30,437
Are you with me or not?

20
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:32,405
I just called
for a vote tomorrow,

21
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:34,041
and I hope you've been
saving your money,

22
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:36,242
because your gravy train's
about to leave the station.

23
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:51,091
Oh, hello.

24
00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:52,692
- I was just...
- Working.

25
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:55,228
I see that,
but it's 7:30 in the morning.

26
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,197
What are you doing here
so early?

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,899
I like to get in
before the chaos starts.

28
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,468
Tell you the truth,
I was under the impression

29
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:03,636
that you wouldn't get in
till much later.

30
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:05,071
I wanted to get a jump
on the day.

31
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,874
Then maybe you should get
a jump on this.

32
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:09,809
Why am I paying
Louis's laundry bill?

33
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:10,944
Because if you pay it,

34
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,712
he won't know
that we triple-starched

35
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:13,780
all of his shirts.

36
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:15,215
- We?
- Yes, we.

37
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,450
He came after us.
We're coming after him.

38
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,152
Did you think
I wouldn't have your back?

39
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:20,187
You want the truth?

40
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:21,588
I thought
you'd be asking for a raise

41
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,956
after seeing
how much I make.

42
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:24,524
I didn't look
at how much you make.

43
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:25,759
And as far as I'm concerned,

44
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,994
anyone who did
should be fired.

45
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,479
You're all right, Gretchen.

46
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:30,864
But for the time being,

47
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,183
don't play any more jokes
on Louis.

48
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,567
Mind if I ask why?

49
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:35,969
Because I only play jokes
on people

50
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:37,570
to express my affection
for them,

51
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:41,107
and right now I have
no affection for Louis Litt.

52
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:45,211
Looks like I got here
just in time.

53
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:46,646
And why is that?

54
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,914
Because I'm going
to ask you to do something

55
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:49,215
you're not going
to want to do,

56
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:50,650
only this time
you're going to do it.

57
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,118
What didn't I do last time?

58
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,188
I told you to apologize
to Louis.

59
00:01:55,223 --> 00:01:57,791
And I did, right before
he held hands with Jack Soloff

60
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,976
and cut my earnings
in front of the entire firm.

61
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:01,578
And if you hadn't have been
such a dick to Jack

62
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:02,729
in the first place,

63
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:04,497
Louis would have had
nowhere to go.

64
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,099
This isn't about Louis,
is it?

65
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:07,200
No, it isn't.

66
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:08,701
I want you to bury
the hatchet with Jack.

67
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,036
You mean you want me
to kiss his ass.

68
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,471
I mean I want you
to figure out a way

69
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,773
to make peace with a partner
whose influence is on the rise.

70
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:15,041
That's kissing his ass.

71
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:16,342
Well, if that's how
you want to look at it,

72
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:18,845
then pucker up,
because that man is a threat,

73
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,213
and he's aligned with Louis,

74
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:22,682
and I am in no mood
for a power struggle.

75
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:33,443
- Hey.
- Hey.

76
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:34,944
I didn't hear
you leave today.

77
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:36,596
That's because I left
at 5:00 in the morning,

78
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,147
trying to get an early start
on this case.

79
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,949
Mm.

80
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,868
Uh, about that...

81
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,536
I didn't want to say
anything last night

82
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:45,171
because you were
so excited...

83
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,941
But you're worried about me
working with your father.

84
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,309
- Yes.
- Hmm.

85
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,144
Mike, you're the two most
important men in my life.

86
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:53,947
Neither of you back down
from a fight,

87
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:55,548
and I'm just...

88
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:57,851
I'm afraid you're gonna
end up hating each other.

89
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:02,755
Rachel, do you hate
your father?

90
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,657
Of course not.
I love my dad.

91
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:07,026
And don't you have conflicts
with him all the time?

92
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,779
Yes, I do,
but it's different.

93
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,197
He's my family.

94
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,333
Yeah, he's gonna be
my family too.

95
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:15,018
And if I'm lucky,
I'm gonna fight with him

96
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,036
about a lot of things
over the years.

97
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,438
So why not start with a fight

98
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,106
where we're both
on the same side?

99
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,710
Okay, I trust you.

100
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,812
Good.

101
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,536
Jessica, you have a minute?

102
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,154
I do if you're here
to tell me

103
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,756
why Robert Zane
is sitting in the lobby

104
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,291
with an appointment
to see you.

105
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:39,792
'Cause I'm pretty sure
he's not taking time

106
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,694
out of his busy morning
to talk about centerpieces.

107
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,763
No, he's not.

108
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:47,867
He is here to co-counsel
the Kelton case.

109
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:50,136
You mean the case
I explicitly told you to drop?

110
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,872
I mean the case that you said
would cost a fortune to fund

111
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,974
and you didn't wanna lay out
that kind of money for.

112
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,043
I didn't want to lay it out
because this case is a loser.

113
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:58,344
And I'm telling you
it's not.

114
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,747
And even if it is,
I just took away our downside.

115
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,416
By going behind my back
to our biggest competitor.

116
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,184
Are you telling me that
you're scared of Robert Zane?

117
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,719
I'd be a fool if I wasn't.

118
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,388
And you're a fool
if you're not.

119
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:09,689
We let that man
into our house,

120
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:10,723
there's no telling
what he'll do.

121
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,791
You know what, Jessica?

122
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:12,892
If Harvey had done this,
you'd be pissed,

123
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,860
but you'd let him
do it anyway.

124
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:15,295
And you may be
as cocky as him,

125
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,831
but you are not Harvey.

126
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,184
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

127
00:04:21,236 --> 00:04:22,535
I guess I'll just
go tell Robert

128
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,487
that we won't be working
together on this after all.

129
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,006
You know damn well
if we tell him that now,

130
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:29,609
I look weak.

131
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:31,311
So maybe I am
as good as Harvey.

132
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:33,479
Well, sometimes
that's not a good thing.

133
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,449
Where are you going?

134
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:38,468
To get
some goddamn strength back.

135
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:42,822
Then go ahead and do it.

136
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,173
I won't just take you
to the woodshed.

137
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,659
I'll leave you there, dead.

138
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,730
Well, looks like you're
making yourself comfortable

139
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,465
in my offices.

140
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,567
About as comfortable
as possible in these chairs.

141
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:56,369
You ever hear
of lumbar support?

142
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:59,105
I get it.
You like stodgy and functional.

143
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,342
But these are my chairs,
just like this is my case.

144
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:04,677
What exactly are you
doing here, Jessica?

145
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:05,713
I'm here to tell you

146
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:06,913
we're taking
half the contingency.

147
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:08,848
And I'm here to respond.
I'm giving you 1/3.

148
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,149
We brought this case to you.

149
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,985
After you found it in a box
crying for its mama.

150
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,553
Plus, I'm footing the bill,

151
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:15,755
which means
this fee discussion is over.

152
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,891
Well, this fee discussion
may be over,

153
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:23,262
but the power discussion
is just getting started.

154
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,865
You don't give a shit
about the money, do you?

155
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,467
On this particular case,

156
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:29,902
all I give a shit about
is keeping you in check.

157
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:32,205
Which means, for the duration
of this matter,

158
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,574
you will be treating
Mike Ross like a partner.

159
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:36,109
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

160
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:37,677
That boy barely shaves.

161
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,878
I don't care
if he's still in diapers.

162
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:40,213
He's representing my firm,

163
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,714
which means
he's representing me.

164
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,851
You look at him,
you see me.

165
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,986
You're asking
for a hell of a lot.

166
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:48,221
Then take your wingtips
off my table

167
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:49,256
and walk 'em
out the door,

168
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,923
because this is my case

169
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,079
and you either do it my way
or you don't do it at all.

170
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:56,729
Mm.

171
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,601
I love you.

172

178
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,790

Louis,
it's not my birthday.

185
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:45,812
I know, but I know
that you weren't happy

186
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:48,181
with the position I put you in
regarding Harvey's compensation,

187
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:49,883
so I just wanted to make sure
that you and I were okay.

188
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,619
Actually, you wanna
know the truth?

189
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:54,955
Right at this second,
I'm not okay.

190
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,122
Then please tell me,

191
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:57,524
what can I do
to make it okay?

192
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,858
You can start
by never putting me

193
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:01,061
in a position like that again.

194
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,996
I won't.

195
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,952
Jack, I need to talk to you.

196
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:11,371
Sure, Louis,
what can I do for you?

197
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:14,174
Well, you can consider me
out of your war with Harvey.

198
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:15,508
What are you talking about?

199
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:16,810
I'm saying that I don't like
what I did,

200
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:18,612
and from now on, I don't want
anything to do with it.

201
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,113
Fine by me, Louis.

202
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,817
As far as I'm concerned,
I won my war with Harvey.

203
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,092
This is your office?

204
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:33,426
Why do you say it like that?

205
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:35,462
- Like what?
- With disgust.

206
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,997
'Cause Harvey's got
autographed basketballs

207
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:38,164
and vintage records,

208
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,768
and you've got a photograph
of a guy's shoes.

209
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:43,270
Well, you better be careful

210
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:45,038
or Sergeant Hulka
with the big toe

211
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:47,574
is gonna see how far
he can stick it up your ass.

212
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:51,044
What the hell
are you talking about?

213
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,612
<i>Stripes.</i>

214
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,414
I'm just quoting<i> Stripes.</i>

215
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:55,348
It's a movie.

216
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:56,916
Harvey and I do this
all the time.

217
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:58,285
Look, I don't know
what kind of teenage nonsense

218
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,886
you got going on with him,
but I don't do that shit.

219
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:00,987
Okay.

220
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,124
I'm going to visit
the facility.

221
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:05,925
Meet you down in the lobby
in ten.

222
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:08,328
I take it that means that
things went well with Jessica?

223
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,163
Yep, she signed off,
and all I had to do

224
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,600
was agree to treat you
as a full and equal partner.

225
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:15,135
Whoa, that must have hurt.

226
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,670
Eh, it didn't hurt a bit, 'cause
I didn't mean it with her,

227
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,271
and I'm not gonna do it
with you.

228
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,073
See you in 10.

229
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,676
Better make that 15.

230
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:30,483
Heard you're looking for me.

231
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:33,086
I was, because I wanted
to give you this.

232
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:34,054
What's that?

233
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,855
Directions to
Westchester Country Club.

234
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,490
Why are you
giving them to me?

235
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,592
Because I don't want you to be
late to your 11:30 tee time

236
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,328
with Charles Barkley.

237
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,496
I'm playing golf
with Charles Barkley?

238
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,265
If you get there on time,
you are.

239
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,833
If not and he starts whacking
at shit with his big club,

240
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:47,784
he might kill someone.

241
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:49,102
You'll miss the whole thing.

242
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,738
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

243
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:53,873
You're sucking up to me
'cause all of a sudden

244
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,408
you realized I'm someone
to be reckoned with.

245
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:56,609
That is what I'm doing.

246
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,279
But you're a big golfer
and a bigger Barkley fan,

247
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,781
and I thought we could use this
to get off to a fresh start.

248
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,166
Here's the problem, Harvey.

249
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,785
I don't give a shit
about Charles Barkley,

250
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:07,420
and you don't give a shit
about me.

251
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,622
Listen to me.
This is a gesture.

252
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:10,757
Take it.

253
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:12,258
I'm not gonna take it,

254
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:13,593
and I'm gonna tell you why.

255
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:14,961
Because you've never
treated me like a peer.

256
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,381
You've only ever treated me
like competition.

257
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,801
I'm trying very hard here.

258
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,021
Well, you can stop trying,
because I'm not interested.

259
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:35,782
Mr. Specter,
I swear he told me

260
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,700
he was
a huge Charles Barkley fan.

261
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:40,403
I'm sure he did,
but the problem is he lied,

262
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,905
and you should've known it.

263
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,830
Whatever you're doing,
put it back.

264
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:52,749
- I need you.
- I can't.

265
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,801
What do you mean, you can't?
We're about to go to war.

266
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:56,553
I mean, I'm about
to go to war myself.

267
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:57,837
What the hell
are you talking about?

268
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,172
I'm taking a case
against Kelton Insurance.

269
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,840
I gotta go meet the client
right now.

270
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:02,058
Who the hell
authorized that?

271
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:03,094
Jessica.

272
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,761
You went to Jessica
instead of me?

273
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,896
I didn't go to anyone,
all right?

274
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,565
She came to me
after I took it.

275
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,266
Well, I'm telling you, you're
gonna have to postpone it.

276
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,901
Harvey, this case
is important.

277
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:13,353
I'll tell you
what's important.

278
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:15,405
I got a partner at this firm
coming at me.

279
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,740
Well, I didn't know that
when I committed to this.

280
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:19,359
What the hell? I thought
we were meeting in the lobby.

281
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,411
You gotta be kidding me.
Your case is with him?

282
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:22,829
You're damn right
it's with me.

283
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:25,198
And we have
a first impression to make.

284
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,783
I don't know what kind of law
you're teaching around here,

285
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,668
but where I come from,
you show up on time.

286
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:31,121
Let's go.

287
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,105
You wanna go?

288
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,473
Go.

289
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:43,149
Jessica,
what can I do for you?

290
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:44,784
You came to me
for some legal advice.

291
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,152
Now I'm coming to you
for yours.

292
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,021
Do I get to charge you
for it?

293
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:50,023
You already do,
unless you suddenly

294
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:52,058
started paying for law school
out of your own pocket.

295
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:53,726
Free of charge it is.

296
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:55,395
I want you to look this over

297
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,798
and tell me if we have
any exposure.

298
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,567
Okay, but this isn't a deal.

299
00:11:00,602 --> 00:11:01,602
This is a speech.

300
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:02,669
I'm aware of that,

301
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,270
but Gwen Barnes
is quite opinionated,

302
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,705
and I don't want her
to say something

303
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,140
that might get her sued.

304
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:09,008
Dr. Gwendolyn Barnes?

305
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,477
Do you have
a problem with her?

306
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:12,278
No, not at all.
How much time do I have?

307
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:13,546
Take as long as you want.

308
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:15,262
Just make sure
whenever I come back for it,

309
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,850
it's done.

310
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:19,319
What are you doing in here?

311
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,703
I came to apologize.

312
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:22,489
You don't need
to apologize.

313
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,790
I was out of line.

314
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,059
Soloff's an asshole,
and it wasn't your fault.

315
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:29,345
No, you were right.
It was my fault.

316
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,264
Well, what's done is done.

317
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,850
If you don't mind,
I need to think right now.

318
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:37,270
I'm sorry, Mr. Specter,
but what's done is not done.

319
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,521
What are you talking about?

320
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,774
I told you,
I got your back.

321
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,326
What the hell is this?

322
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:46,279
It's the bio of that asshole's
third biggest client.

323
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,815
- And?
- Look where he's from.

324
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:05,622
I appreciate you coming
all the way down here,

325
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,324
but the last time
you came to me,

326
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,960
you told me to sit tight,
and that was a week ago.

327
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,929
Emma, I don't understand.

328
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:12,996
What did you expect?

329
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,832
I expected you to understand
what it feels like

330
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,067
to be left hanging.

331
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,003
Because if we can't
understand that,

332
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,006
what's to stop us
from cutting and running

333
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,541
when things get tough?

334
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,660
And what is
gonna stop you?

335
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,779
I know what's gonna
stop me.

336
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,749
First year...you think
about it every day.

337
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,455
You relive it.

338
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,706
Doesn't matter
what you do.

339
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,559
You can't get it
out of your head.

340
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:45,195
People tell you
it's part of God's plan.

341
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,198
Maybe they're right,
but it doesn't stop you

342
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,566
from wanting
to punch them in the face

343
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,535
every time they say it.

344
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,872
Then time passes,

345
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,841
two, three years.

346
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,345
Maybe you even start
to feel normal.

347
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,613
Maybe you start to believe

348
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:07,184
that maybe this thing
won't actually scar you

349
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,719
for the rest of your life.

350
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,021
But then one day,

351
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,323
something reminds you.

352
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,160
A song or a...
or a smell.

353
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,064
And it touches that nerve,
and all of a sudden,

354
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,034
it's the day you got that news
all over again.

355
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,671
So you have gone through
something like this yourself?

356
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:37,014
I haven't just
gone through it.

357
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,683
It's the entire reason
that I became a lawyer.

358
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:44,655
And as far as it taking
as long as it did,

359
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,492
it took a while
to work out the particulars.

360
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,695
But I can assure you,

361
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,230
it's worth the wait,

362
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,565
because this right here,

363
00:13:55,601 --> 00:14:00,137
this is an all-star team,
and we're playing for you.

364
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,641
Well...

365
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,181
Where do I sign?

366
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:13,250
All right,
we got that taken care of.

367
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:14,302
Next step?

368
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:15,636
Set up
a settlement conference.

369
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:16,970
Got that right.

370
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,106
You mean "You got that right,
partner."

371
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:20,273
What the hell
are you talking about?

372
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,692
You're the one
that said it yourself.

373
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:23,493
You and me,
we're the all-star team.

374
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,829
I meant I was the all-star.
You're the team.

375
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,913
Oh, so I guess in this case

376
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,915
the team just hit
the game-winning jumper.

377
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,384
I got news for you, team,

378
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,136
the game hasn't
even started yet.

379
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,605
Mike, seriously,
back there,

380
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,542
about your childhood,
I didn't really get it before.

381
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,910
You got dealt a bad hand,

382
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,178
and you pulled yourself up
by your bootstraps,

383
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,312
and I respect that.

384
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,981
Thanks, Robert.

385
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,083
- You can call me "Dad."
- Really?

386
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,852
No.

387
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,370
So you know we're talking
about my father, right,

388
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:51,955
who's no longer alive?

389
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,291
- Yeah, I forgot that.
- You forgot that?

390
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,010
The basis of your compliment
in the first place?

391
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,896
You suck the fun
out of everything, don't you?

392
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,419
You did this quickly.

393
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,940
You gave me a job to do,
and I did it.

394
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,475
And why did you leave it
on my desk

395
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,110
instead of bringing it
to me directly?

396
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,945
I just wanted to give you
a chance to look it over.

397
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,213
And does that have something
to do with the fact

398
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,964
that I asked you
to check it for exposure

399
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,616
and not rewrite it?

400
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:22,586
I know, I may have
overstepped my assignment.

401
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,855
It's just Dr. Barnes
is the first black female

402
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,524
chief of surgery
at a major New York hospital.

403
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:29,159
She faced discrimination
at every turn,

404
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,594
and she still got
the job done,

405
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,598
so she doesn't need soaring
language to communicate that.

406
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,199
I'll tell Dr. Barnes
you said that.

407
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,335
So you're accepting
my changes?

408
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,037
I'll present them to her
with my blessing.

409
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,774
We'll see what she thinks.

410
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:45,809
Jessica, um...

411
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,646
if you ever have a case
with Dr. Barnes,

412
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,248
I would love to be
a part of it.

413
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,315
I have a better idea.

414
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,286
Why don't you come
to the speech with me?

415
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,127
That is exactly why
we need to figure out a way

416
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,313
to get you on the board
of directors of Comcast.

417
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,432
From your lips
to God's ears.

418
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,167
Jack, I'm sorry.
Can I speak to you for a second?

419
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,768
Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something.

420
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,236
It'll only take a minute.
It's firm business.

421
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,172
I'm afraid
it's not optional.

422
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,773
I'm sorry to interrupt.

423
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,443
Harvey Specter, by the way,
of Pearson Specter.

424
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,146
This will only
take a second.

425
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,848
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

426
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,750
You're trying to poach
my client.

427
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,218
What makes you think
I'm trying to do that?

428
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,454
Please, "Harvey Specter
of Pearson Specter."

429
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,721
Let me tell you something,

430
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,423
guy's been my client
for ten years.

431
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,559
He's not leaving me
for the likes of you.

432
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,893
Then I guess
our business here is done.

433
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,328
What the hell is going on?

434
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,863
Nothing's going on.
You're free.

435
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,848
In fact,
I'll walk you back.

436
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,202
Oh, look at that.

437
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,586
Is that Charles Barkley
taking a selfie

438
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,678
with your loyal client
who happened to have grown up

439
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,474
in Philadelphia
during the Barkley era?

440
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,509
Look, you might not
give a shit about Charles,

441
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,744
but he sure as hell does.

442
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,846
You son of a bitch.

443
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,280
I'm sorry, Jack.
Could you repeat that?

444
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,398
I couldn't hear you
over the sound

445
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,649
of me taking your client.

446
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,885
Then let me say it louder.
This isn't over.

447
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,820
It better be, because you've got
four other clients

448
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,323
from Chicago, Boston,
Los Angeles, and Houston.

449
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,692
And you may not know
who those famous ballers are,

450
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,677
but I do.

451
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,567
Will, Jennifer, thank you for
seeing us on such short notice.

452
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,986
Well, you did serve
our client with a lawsuit.

453
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,305
Nevertheless,
we have an offer for you.

454
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,079
You've gotta be kidding me.

455
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,814
You called us all the way
down here for this?

456
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,482
I wouldn't wipe my ass
with this.

457
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:34,384
Well, Robert, we don't
look at it that way.

458
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:37,254
How exactly
do you look at it, Will?

459
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,523
We look at it as a gift
to a couple of vultures

460
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,992
trying to pick the flesh
off the bones of an old case.

461
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,226
That is what every lawyer

462
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,162
who has had something to hide
has ever said.

463
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,730
And it doesn't change the fact

464
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,732
that your client
killed 200 people.

465
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,867
Then we're gonna tell you
what we told the last attorney.

466
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,519
You go to trial,
you'll be buried in paperwork

467
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:53,870
for the next ten years.

468
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,505
Well, if this were yesterday,

469
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,174
then we might be rattled
by that.

470
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,310
But since then, new information
has come to light.

471
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,329
And what new information
is that?

472
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,181
This is a list of everyone
who works at my firm.

473
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,851
And this is a list
of everyone that works at mine.

474
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,153
You see, we're not
some solo practitioner

475
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,589
with a part-time paralegal
working out of a mall.

476
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:17,160
What my associate is getting at
is we're two huge law firms,

477
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,063
perfectly designed
to kick your ass.

478
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,831
I don't care how many people
work at your firms.

479
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,733
Someone needs
to pay their salaries.

480
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,335
And if you're
working on this,

481
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,736
you're not doing that.

482
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,071
Then doesn't it
come in handy

483
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:31,541
to have a $20-billion hedge fund
footing the bill?

484
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,012
So you can either add
a bunch of zeroes

485
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,798
to this bullshit offer,
or we'll see you in court.

486
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,581
Mind if I ask you
a question?

487
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:52,882
If it's about
using my connections

488
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,851
to get Stevie Wonder
to play at your wedding,

489
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:58,388
I already tried.

490
00:18:58,423 --> 00:19:01,024
Why didn't you tell me
about the hedge fund?

491
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,225
Well, what difference
does it make

492
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,360
where we get
our money from?

493
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:04,527
It doesn't make
a difference,

494
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:06,863
except for the fact
you didn't tell me.

495
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:09,165
What are you getting
so bent out of shape for?

496
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:10,667
We landed a punch
back there.

497
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:12,268
We landed a punch
or you did?

498
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,787
What's that
supposed to mean?

499
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:16,222
First you call me "associate"
in front of opposing counsel,

500
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:17,874
and now I find out
you're keeping things from me.

501
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:18,925
Look...

502
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,710
I'm just saying,
are we a team or not?

503
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:22,879
I called you
what I called you in there

504
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:24,614
because they want to see
someone in charge.

505
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,351
And looking at the two of us,
they're gonna think it's me.

506
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:30,420
And I didn't think
about telling you about Arcadian

507
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:33,523
because I came up with that
when you weren't there.

508
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,893
For the record,
I had the same idea.

509
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:39,129
I went to a hedge fund
before I even came to you.

510
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:40,196
Well, congratulations.

511
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:41,898
If you had closed them
like I closed my guys,

512
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,733
I wouldn't be standing here
explaining myself.

513
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:46,519
So let's talk when we hear back
from these clowns.

514
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:49,506
And put a smile on your face.
You kicked ass in there.

515
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,617
Jack, what can I do for you?

516
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:02,168
You can get your dog
on a leash.

517
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:03,370
Excuse me?

518
00:20:03,422 --> 00:20:06,339
Harvey just stole
one of my clients.

519
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,091
I want him back.

520
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:09,259
Do you have proof?

521
00:20:09,294 --> 00:20:11,177
Yeah, he orchestrated
some bullshit run-in

522
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:12,429
with Charles Barkley,

523
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:15,515
and miraculously my client,
he needs to make a change.

524
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,267
Well, that's not proof.

525
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:19,135
I don't need proof.
I know what the hell he did.

526
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:20,637
Just like I know
what you and Louis did

527
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,672
to pass
your compensation resolution.

528
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,973
And if I had proof of that,

529
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:25,275
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

530
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,976
We'd be having
your exit interview.

531
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,862
You gonna sling
accusations at me,

532
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:31,398
or you gonna get your dog Harvey
under control?

533
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,982
'Cause if you can't
control him,

534
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:34,984
maybe you shouldn't be
in control of this firm.

535
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,069
Control him?

536
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:37,570
Let me tell you
something, Jack.

537
00:20:37,622 --> 00:20:40,707
When you went after Harvey,
you went after me,

538
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:42,041
which is why I'm the one

539
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:44,127
that sent him after you
in the first place.

540
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:46,830
And I just put more money
in every other partner's pocket,

541
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:49,416
which means you better
listen to me when I talk.

542
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:52,085
There's only so many times
you can pull some shady shit

543
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:54,337
to get something done
with the partners.

544
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:56,172
So you want
to take me on?

545
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:57,724
I'm right here.

546
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:13,790
Hey.

547
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:16,409
Hey.

548
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:18,945
What are you working on?

549
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,697
The Kelton case.

550
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:22,782
Ha.

551
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:25,268
I've been meaning
to ask you,

552
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:27,704
how's it going
with my dad?

553
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:30,340
It's fine.

554
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,758
It's, uh...
it's going fine.

555
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,376
Mm-hmm, it's fine.

556
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:35,261
I know what "it's fine" means.

557
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:38,298
"It's fine" means
it's not fine,

558
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,218
and you're realizing
that I was right

559
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,386
and you were wrong,

560
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:47,056
and he is a giant pain
in the ass.

561
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:50,643
Rachel, I never said
there wouldn't be arguments.

562
00:21:50,695 --> 00:21:53,897
I just said ultimately
they'd bring us closer.

563
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:55,982
I know, you did.

564
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:58,451
I'm not trying
to cause trouble.

565
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:03,206
I was just trying to be
charming and delightful.

566
00:22:06,328 --> 00:22:07,328
Thanks.

567
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,745
Mm-hmm.

568
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:15,001
It's just...

569
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:17,787
It's important to me
that your dad respects me.

570
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:22,859
If there is one thing
that I am certain of,

571
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:27,096
it's that my father
respects you.

572
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:28,064
Okay?

573
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:34,704
* *

574
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:35,939
Harvey, you were right.

575
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:37,774
That's one of the best steaks
I ever had.

576
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:40,343
How about you tell me why
you actually brought me here?

577
00:22:40,378 --> 00:22:42,662
Can't a man just take
his client out to dinner?

578
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,747
A man can,
but you need something,

579
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:46,223
and I just did you
that little favor.

580
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:47,350
That wasn't a favor.

581
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:49,686
I took 15 minutes of pictures
with some dipshit

582
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:50,854
from Philadelphia.

583
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:52,155
That's not a favor?

584
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:53,356
That was an appetizer.

585
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:55,658
I need you to get Magic,
Bird, Hakeem, and Michael

586
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:57,293
to do the same thing.

587
00:22:57,295 --> 00:22:58,935
You're a funny guy.
You're kidding, right?

588
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:00,296
Did I ask you
if you were kidding me

589
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:02,048
when you called me
that night?

590
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,684
You asked me to sign with you,
and I did.

591
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,803
And I also said that
I would need something

592
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:08,271
from you someday,

593
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:11,574
and taking selfies
with some dipshit Sixers fan

594
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,192
isn't gonna cut it.

595
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:15,478
Harvey, you need to chill
with this Soloff thing.

596
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,115
If not, every single day
you go into the office,

597
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,067
he's gonna be trying
to stab you in the back.

598
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,452
I'm not here to get
your advice, Charles.

599
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:23,703
I'm here to get you
to help me.

600
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:25,655
I'm not getting
the Dream Team back together.

601
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,740
It can happen
if you make it happen.

602
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:29,709
It's not gonna happen.

603
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:33,129
And the Harvey I know
would never ask me to do it.

604
00:23:33,164 --> 00:23:34,914
Listen, leave a big tip.

605
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:37,166
People think
I'm paying for the meal.

606
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:41,237
Put down whatever you're doing.

607
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:42,672
We need to talk.

608
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:44,240
You're talking
to a name partner,

609
00:23:44,276 --> 00:23:46,175
so I suggest you do it
with a little respect.

610
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:48,261
I'm showing respect
by coming to you

611
00:23:48,313 --> 00:23:49,929
to hit Harvey
where it hurts.

612
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:50,930
I told you,
I don't want anything to do

613
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:52,181
with your war with Harvey.

614
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:53,349
You already have something
to do with it.

615
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,268
And you said you didn't care
if I backed out.

616
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,853
I don't give a shit
what I said.

617
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:59,739
You picked a side.
There's no going back.

618
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:04,777
Absolutely not.

619
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:07,196
I'm not doing it.
This is way too far, Jack.

620
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:09,966
No, it's what we should have
done in the first place.

621
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:11,200
Well, you know,
it doesn't even matter,

622
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,936
because you can't introduce
a resolution like this,

623
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:14,504
'cause it violates the bylaws.

624
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:15,772
Then you need to do
some underhanded shit

625
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:18,007
to make it unviolate
the bylaws.

626
00:24:18,043 --> 00:24:19,459
And I already told you

627
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:21,377
that I'm not doing anything
like that again.

628
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:23,179
Too bad,
because you did it once.

629
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:26,265
And if you don't want me
telling anybody about it,

630
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:28,384
you'll do it again.

631
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:36,978
Good morning, Louis.

632
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:37,979
Well, looks like
you've been busy.

633
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:39,197
I have.

634
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:40,398
Here's the Crenshaw depo,

635
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,500
and this is
the Kirsch itinerary,

636
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:44,502
and here's your music box.

637
00:24:44,537 --> 00:24:46,471
Why are you giving
my gift back?

638
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:48,106
Because it was a gift
you gave me with a promise

639
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:49,741
never to put me in a position
like that again.

640
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:51,016
- And I haven't.
- But you will.

641
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:52,610
And don't tell me you won't,
because I overheard

642
00:24:52,646 --> 00:24:54,212
your little scheme
with Jack Soloff.

643
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:55,913
Then you obviously heard me
tell him to go to hell.

644
00:24:55,949 --> 00:24:57,982
No, Louis,
I heard him tell you

645
00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,684
that you're in this war
whether you like it or not.

646
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,569
And then he walked out
that door,

647
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:03,421
and you didn't say
a damn thing.

648
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:04,989
I swear I'm gonna
keep my promise.

649
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,591
I am not going after Harvey.

650
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:09,494
You think this is about me
protecting Harvey?

651
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:11,329
This is about me
protecting me.

652
00:25:11,364 --> 00:25:12,297
What are you talking about?

653
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:13,364
Harvey came to me
the other night

654
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,350
to get me to admit
that I knew what you did.

655
00:25:15,385 --> 00:25:16,701
He came to you?

656
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:17,969
In my home.

657
00:25:18,004 --> 00:25:20,438
And I had to stand there
and lose my integrity

658
00:25:20,473 --> 00:25:22,473
in front of him for you.

659
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:25,243
Oh, my God,
he's really doing it.

660
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:26,744
Doing what?

661
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:30,248
After the compensation vote,

662
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:31,749
Harvey and I
got into a fight,

663
00:25:31,785 --> 00:25:34,385
and I told him that
I'd just taken away

664
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:36,921
the one thing
he values most:

665
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:39,791
his money.

666
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:41,492
He then tells me
that he's gonna come

667
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:43,828
after the one thing
that I value most.

668
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:44,996
Me.

669
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:46,097
Yes.

670
00:25:46,132 --> 00:25:49,367
Told me that one day
I would come to this office,

671
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:51,836
you'd be gone,

672
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:53,971
and I'd know that it was him
who took you away from me.

673
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:56,808
He said he was gonna
take me away?

674
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,110
Listen to me.

675
00:25:59,145 --> 00:26:02,780
I swear I will never
do that to you again.

676
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:05,983
But please do not leave me.

677
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:08,686
I'm not leaving you, Louis.

678
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:15,793
You get this?

679
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:18,830
Sure did.
Motion to dismiss.

680
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:20,498
Yeah. You know
what this means, right?

681
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,899
We got 'em on the ropes.
They're scared.

682
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:24,268
Which is why
I scheduled a hearing

683
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,437
with Judge Hernandez
for tomorrow morning.

684
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:28,906
She's gonna dismiss
this bullshit,

685
00:26:28,942 --> 00:26:32,360
and I'm gonna get her to move
straight to trial.

686
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:36,197
Uh, Robert,
that's a bad idea.

687
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:37,448
What are you
talking about?

688
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,368
They throw a jab,
we answer with a right cross.

689
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,003
Yes, if we go to trial now,
we get a decision,

690
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:43,621
but if we go in three months,
we get a knockout.

691
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:44,956
What the hell
are you talking about?

692
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,174
There's a bill
on the governor's desk

693
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:47,759
waiting to be passed.

694
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:49,460
It lifts the cap
on punitive damages.

695
00:26:49,462 --> 00:26:51,429
There's a reason
he hasn't signed it yet.

696
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:53,297
The AMA is up his ass.

697
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:54,932
We go now.

698
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:58,002
The CEO of Kelton Insurance's
contract is up.

699
00:26:58,037 --> 00:26:59,720
He doesn't want
to be renegotiating

700
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:01,272
while he's on the front page
of the<i> Journal</i>

701
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,547
being accused
of killing people.

702
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,941
That threat
takes these people

703
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:06,310
from $1,000 per person
to $5,000,

704
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:07,728
but if we actually
go to trial...

705
00:27:07,781 --> 00:27:11,115
If we go to trial,
we may get nothing.

706
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:14,368
And I'm finished having
this conversation.

707
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:16,487
So now I see where we stand.
We're not partners.

708
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:17,489
I'm just the associate.

709
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,790
You're the one
calling the shots.

710
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:19,905
I thought I made that clear

711
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:21,075
from the second
we started this thing.

712
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:23,661
Now answer this motion,
get my motion done,

713
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:24,996
and be in court
tomorrow morning,

714
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:27,198
because this is gonna happen
whether you like it or not.

715
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,672
Oh...what the hell?

716
00:27:34,724 --> 00:27:35,724
What the hell what?

717
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:37,141
You spilled my coffee.

718
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:38,559
You ran into me.

719
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:40,228
I don't care
who ran into who.

720
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:42,597
This is my office.
How about a little "excuse me"?

721
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,816
Oh, okay, Harvey.
Excuse me.

722
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:46,767
Feel free to send me
the bill for dry cleaning.

723
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,403
I'm paying
for everything else around here.

724
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:59,864
Donna, now is not
a good time.

725
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:01,282
I don't care.

726
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,734
I'm not a prize to be used
to get revenge on Louis.

727
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,902
What the hell
are you talking about?

728
00:28:04,938 --> 00:28:06,270
Are you gonna deny
you told him

729
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:07,405
that you were gonna
take me back?

730
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,207
That is not what I said.

731
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,591
No, do not lawyer me,

732
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:12,126
because it may not be
exactly what you said,

733
00:28:12,178 --> 00:28:14,178
but don't try to tell me
it wasn't what you meant.

734
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:15,263
Donna...

735
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:16,380
And another thing,
what makes you think

736
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:18,349
if I were ever to leave Louis

737
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:21,802
that I would ever,
ever come back to you?

738
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:32,730
Mr. Specter,
I know this is a bad time,

739
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:34,365
but I have to remind you
that...

740
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,134
I know!
Jessica wants to see me.

741
00:28:46,312 --> 00:28:48,262
Donna, hey, can I talk
to you for a second?

742
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:50,014
It's actually not a good time
right this second.

743
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:51,816
It's important.

744
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:52,884
I just need to know if Harvey

745
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,319
is still tight
with Judge Hernandez.

746
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:55,486
Why?

747
00:28:55,522 --> 00:28:56,888
I need her to postpone
a hearing for me.

748
00:28:56,923 --> 00:28:57,855
You know what, Mike?

749
00:28:57,891 --> 00:28:59,023
If you want something
from Harvey,

750
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:01,225
you're gonna have
to ask him yourself.

751
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,027
You wanted to see me?

752
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:04,645
That was 12 hours ago.

753
00:29:04,697 --> 00:29:07,031
I was putting
some things in order.

754
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,566
What things in order,

755
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,418
stealing more
of Jack Soloff's clients?

756
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,969
As a matter of fact, yes.

757
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:13,137
God damn it, Harvey.

758
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:15,006
Jessica, I went in there.
I tried to make peace.

759
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,108
He spat in my face.

760
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:18,643
I tried again.
He did it again.

761
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:19,977
And I said,
"Enough is enough."

762
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,913
Then you walk out the door.
You don't steal his clients.

763
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:23,898
You know what?
This doesn't concern you.

764
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:25,316
This is
between me and Jack.

765
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:27,285
Oh, it was between you and Jack
until he came to me,

766
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:29,353
and I had
to cover for you.

767
00:29:29,389 --> 00:29:30,721
You covered for me?

768
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:31,923
Goddamn right I did.

769
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,958
I told him sending you
after him was my idea

770
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:34,993
in the first place.

771
00:29:34,994 --> 00:29:35,993
That's not covering for me.

772
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:37,461
That's covering for you,

773
00:29:37,497 --> 00:29:39,630
because that should have been
your idea in the first place,

774
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,832
instead of welcoming
every competitor we have

775
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:43,768
into our offices
behind my back.

776
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,036
What the hell
are you talking about?

777
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:46,604
I'm talking
about Robert Zane

778
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:49,540
and you bringing him in here
without consulting me.

779
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:50,775
I didn't bring in shit.

780
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,010
Mike Ross brought Zane in
without asking,

781
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:55,012
and I had to pretend to be
on board with that too.

782
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:57,598
And now you're hoping this leads
to what you always wanted.

783
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,250
This thing's over,
Zane goes,

784
00:29:59,285 --> 00:30:00,818
and Mike heads
out the door with him.

785
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:01,969
That's enough.

786
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:04,155
You need to get yourself
under control right now.

787
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,473
What the hell
are you talking about?

788
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:07,108
I'm talking about
you have a problem,

789
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,960
and it doesn't have
anything to do with me.

790
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:10,361
And you just expose it
by bringing up

791
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:12,530
some paranoid bullshit
about Mike Ross

792
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:14,131
going with Robert Zane.

793
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:16,901
Because this all started
when Donna left you,

794
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:18,069
and now you're afraid

795
00:30:18,104 --> 00:30:19,804
that Mike's going to do
the same thing.

796
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,072
So you better get

797
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:22,873
your abandonment issues
under control,

798
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:25,059
because Jack Soloff
is gonna keep coming,

799
00:30:25,094 --> 00:30:27,445
and now you're gonna
have to put him down.

800
00:30:49,602 --> 00:30:50,968
Mr. Specter,

801
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,406
Mike Ross is waiting for you
in your office.

802
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:56,807
Hey, I need to talk to you.

803
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:58,342
Not now.

804
00:30:58,394 --> 00:31:00,354
I know you're mad from before,
but I need a favor.

805
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,046
I said not now.

806
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:03,364
Harvey, what's going on
with you?

807
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:06,200
Nothing's wrong.
I need a glass of water.

808
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:08,219
What the hell
is going on?

809
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:18,696
Okay,
I'm dialing 911.

810
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:19,964
No, you're not.

811
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,432
Yes, I am. You could be
having a heart attack.

812
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:25,436
- It's not a heart attack.
- You don't know that.

813
00:31:25,438 --> 00:31:27,071
It's a panic attack.

814
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,710
Oh, hate to interrupt
a special moment,

815
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:36,747
but I thought you might wanna
take a gander at this.

816
00:31:36,783 --> 00:31:38,649
What the hell is that?

817
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:41,118
If you recall,
our last proposal

818
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:43,087
reduced contingent
compensation.

819
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:45,856
This one wipes it out
altogether.

820
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,760
What's the matter?
No snappy comeback?

821
00:31:49,796 --> 00:31:51,495
I've read the bylaws.
You can't do that.

822
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:53,030
You doing his fighting
for him now?

823
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:54,346
I don't care
what the bylaws say.

824
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,100
I have Louis's backing.

825
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:58,269
So either you
give back my client,

826
00:31:58,304 --> 00:32:00,304
or good luck
billing 2,500 hours a year

827
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:02,256
like the rest of us.

828
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:06,477
You go right ahead
and put your proposal to a vote.

829
00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:08,446
But by the time
this thing passes,

830
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:10,047
I'll have
your other four clients.

831
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,866
Bullshit, you couldn't have
gotten to them already.

832
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:14,802
Go goddamn check.
They're already in play.

833
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:16,654
You pass this thing,

834
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:18,255
you won't be billing
anything at all.

835
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:19,657
You're not gonna
get away with that.

836
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:21,525
Wrong.
I didn't start this.

837
00:32:21,561 --> 00:32:22,860
But I'm gonna finish it.

838
00:32:22,912 --> 00:32:25,429
And when you said I only ever
looked at you as competition,

839
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:26,664
you were wrong.

840
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:28,966
I never looked at you
as anything at all.

841
00:32:41,214 --> 00:32:44,148
Are you all right?

842
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:46,484
No.

843
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:02,800
Is it true what you just said
about his clients?

844
00:33:02,835 --> 00:33:04,902
No, which is why
I need you

845
00:33:04,904 --> 00:33:06,070
to do anything
you have to do

846
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:10,407
to convince him
this is happening.

847
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,243
I'll get it done.

848
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,966
What are you doing here?

849
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:28,434
This is my home.

850
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:29,469
It's also your office.

851
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,554
And that entrance
is right around there.

852
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:33,356
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of my dinner.

853
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,892
I called to set an appointment.
You didn't call back.

854
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:37,026
Because I had patients.

855
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:38,227
And what the hell am I?

856
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:40,696
You're an ex-patient
I haven't seen in weeks,

857
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:42,815
who ignored me when I said
that your panic attacks

858
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,534
wouldn't stop
until you accepted the fact

859
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:46,369
that your secretary
wasn't coming back.

860
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,487
I did accept it,
and I had another one anyway.

861
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,072
That's why I'm here.

862
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:52,208
You mean you're here
to get more pills.

863
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:53,626
Yes, I am.

864
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,044
And what happened
to the ones I gave you?

865
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,079
I threw them out.

866
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,246
Bullshit, you didn't
throw them out.

867
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:58,664
You ran out.

868
00:33:58,716 --> 00:33:59,999
No, I didn't run out.
I'm telling you the truth.

869
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:01,133
Okay, well,
it doesn't matter,

870
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:02,885
because I'm a psychiatrist,
not a pharmacy,

871
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:04,587
and if you want my help,
you do it my way.

872
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:06,055
You make regular appointments,

873
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,924
and you commit
to doing the work.

874
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:09,642
And you show up at my house
unannounced again,

875
00:34:09,677 --> 00:34:12,178
I'm calling the police.

876
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,647
Do you have any time available
ten minutes from now?

877
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:19,602
I want to give you time
to finish your dinner.

878
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:26,943
Is the car ready?

879
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:30,663
It's downstairs
warming up, like you.

880
00:34:30,698 --> 00:34:32,114
What do you mean?

881
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:34,033
Well, I received
the invitation

882
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:35,952
and couldn't help but notice

883
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:38,671
that Dr. Barnes
is in the program,

884
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:41,207
and you're in the program too.

885
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:43,676
Look at that, I am.

886
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:45,962
Why didn't you tell me
it was your speech?

887
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:47,096
I wanted
your honest opinion.

888
00:34:47,131 --> 00:34:48,097
But you didn't ask
for my opinion.

889
00:34:48,132 --> 00:34:49,765
You asked me to check it
for exposure.

890
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,434
If there's one thing
I've noticed about you,

891
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,135
it's that you give
your opinion

892
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:55,271
whether it's asked for
or not.

893
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:59,709
And why does my opinion
matter to you so much

894
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:01,143
that you would
go through all this?

895
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,846
Your opinion
doesn't matter to me.

896
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:05,915
Your development does.

897
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,019
What are you saying?

898
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:15,057
Oh, you're gonna make me
say it out loud?

899
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:16,459
You remind me of me.

900
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:19,829
And what do I have to do
to get to be like you?

901
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:21,464
Well, you should know.

902
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:23,199
You read my damn speech.

903
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:25,701
You mean I rewrote
your damn speech.

904
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:27,670
Oh, shit, I said it.

905
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:29,138
I'm going
to show you mercy,

906
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,307
considering your dress choice.

907
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:32,441
What's wrong with my dress?

908
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:33,493
Oh, you don't know.

909
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:35,311
Come on,
this is really special.

910
00:35:37,915 --> 00:35:40,016
You wanna know the truth?

911
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:42,284
I think you bottled up
your anger at Donna,

912
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,819
let it out at Louis,

913
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:44,787
and then when
it came back at you,

914
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:45,755
you pushed it down again.

915
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,722
That's bullshit.

916
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:48,391
The clinical term
is displacement,

917
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:50,693
and the cure for it is letting
your anger at Donna out.

918
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:51,861
Well, I'm not gonna do that,

919
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:53,863
because even if I would,
Donna's not here.

920
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:55,831
No, I didn't say you had
to let it out at Donna.

921
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:57,033
You can let it out at me.

922
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:58,534
- That's stupid.
- No, it isn't.

923
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:00,569
If she were here
right now,

924
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:02,338
what's the first thing
that comes to your mind?

925
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:03,773
Hey, Donna,
what are you doing here?

926
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:06,008
What if I said,
"I'm here for you"?

927
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:07,343
I'd say, "Shouldn't you be
at Louis's desk?"

928
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:10,446
And what if I were?
How would that make you feel?

929
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:12,448
It would make me feel like
role play is stupid,

930
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:13,549
because you're not Donna,

931
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:14,984
and I don't give a shit
what your degree says.

932
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:16,118
I'm not gonna
go through this again

933
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:17,154
just to get more pills.

934
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:18,487
Well, I may not be Donna,

935
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:20,389
but I'm beginning to see
what it's like to be her.

936
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:21,891
What the hell
are you talking about?

937
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:23,342
I'm talking about
I'm a woman

938
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:25,494
who you've been bullying
to get what you want.

939
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,495
Bullying?
I'm paying you.

940
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:27,913
And that doesn't mean
that I exist

941
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,331
to serve your needs.

942
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:30,566
Well, it goddamn should.

943
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:31,701
If you spoke
to Donna that way,

944
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:32,968
no wonder she left you.

945
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:35,104
Because you don't just
pay people to be loyal.

946
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:36,405
How dare you?

947
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:38,174
I don't give a shit about
the money, and I never did.

948
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,508
No, you didn't.

949
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:41,177
It was just a way to get me
to do what you wanted.

950
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:42,945
So when your life
was on the line

951
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,780
and I was there for you
every step of the way,

952
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:45,782
it meant nothing?

953
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:47,083
It wasn't every step
of the way.

954
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:49,385
You bailed out
the second I wanted more.

955
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,554
That's when you decided
to betray me.

956
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:54,223
How the hell is moving on
and putting myself first

957
00:36:54,258 --> 00:36:55,291
betraying you?

958
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:56,425
Because you went
to Louis to do it,

959
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:57,593
and that's not moving on.

960
00:36:57,645 --> 00:36:59,195
That's sticking a knife
in my gut and twisting it.

961
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,963
Yeah, Harvey, it is.

962
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:03,733
How does it feel to be
on the receiving end for once?

963
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:10,573
Harvey, did you hear me?

964
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:11,974
I said, how does it feel
to know that

965
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:14,610
you've taken the first step
towards regaining control?

966
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,982
When someone twists
a knife in your gut,

967
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:22,752
I feel like I want
to twist one right back.

968
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:26,572
Mr. Zane,
you scheduled this hearing.

969
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:27,740
We've been waiting ten minutes.

970
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:29,408
I'm not waiting any longer.

971
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,127
Uh, you don't have to,
your honor.

972
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:33,045
My motion is here.

973
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:36,348
It better get up here fast.

974
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,983
Where the hell were you?

975
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:39,568
I'm standing up here
with my dick in my hand,

976
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,070
and you're out
having a soda.

977
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:42,371
I had something to do.

978
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:43,606
Yeah, well, whatever it was,

979
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:46,275
I hope it was worth
almost losing this case over.

980
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,660
Motion to expedite trial.

981
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:50,146
I thought this was a hearing
on their motion to dismiss.

982
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:51,947
Well, if you expedite
our trial,

983
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:54,116
that takes care
of their motion to dismiss.

984
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,752
Your Honor, they just got
this case two days ago.

985
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:59,455
They're using the timing of
our client's contract expiration

986
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,923
to try to shake us down.

987
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,858
I have to say, Mr. Zane,
I find it hard to believe

988
00:38:02,894 --> 00:38:05,027
that in two days
you've found out enough

989
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:06,762
to know you need
an expedited trial,

990
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:09,031
let alone
care about these people at all.

991
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:10,533
Your Honor,
four years ago,

992
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,301
a mail carrier named
Stanley Powell

993
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:14,103
felt tightness
in his chest.

994
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:15,471
He thought it was nothing,

995
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:18,007
but his wife insisted
he go to the hospital.

996
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,141
When he got there,

997
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:21,026
doctors couldn't find
anything wrong,

998
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:25,281
but they wanted to keep him
for one extra day.

999
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:26,782
Now unfortunately,

1000
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,951
Kelton Insurance
refused to pay.

1001
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:31,086
So Mr. Powell went home,
crawled into bed,

1002
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:32,788
and one day later,
he was dead.

1003
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:34,264
In front of you,
you have a complaint

1004
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:36,258
that's over 5,000 pages long,

1005
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:39,144
which tells the stories
of another 189 victims.

1006
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:41,297
Pick a page at random,
tell me the number,

1007
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:45,034
and I will tell you exactly
what their client did to them.

1008
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:46,869
Your Honor, are you
actually buying that?

1009
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:52,541
Page 627, Mr....

1010
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:53,592
Lawrence Green.

1011
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:55,211
63-year-old grandfather,

1012
00:38:55,263 --> 00:38:57,880
admitted to St. Vincent with
complaints of lower back pain

1013
00:38:57,932 --> 00:38:59,932
and excessive weight loss.

1014
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:04,553
He thought it was stress.
Turns out it was lymphoma.

1015
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:06,472
Only they didn't find out
until it was too late

1016
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:11,227
because their client
refused to pay for the MRI.

1017
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:13,562
So please, rule against us
if you have to,

1018
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,648
but don't tell me
we don't care.

1019
00:39:16,817 --> 00:39:18,934
Motion for expedited trial
granted.

1020
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,320
Jury selection starts Monday.

1021
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:25,324
For your information,
that's what I was doing.

1022
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:26,825
And it only took
as long as it did

1023
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,794
because I was also doing
something for the one person

1024
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:31,080
who has the right to treat me
like his associate

1025
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:33,415
but treats me
like his partner anyway.

1026
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:36,085
Well, if you can forgive me,

1027
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:39,054
what do you say
I take my partner out to lunch?

1028
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:52,268
* *

1029
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,602
Mr. Specter...

1030
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:54,820
Gretchen, whatever it is,
it can wait till tomorrow.

1031
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:57,022
I'm afraid this can't wait.

1032
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,509
This is your resume.

1033
00:40:00,544 --> 00:40:02,278
I wanted to explain
the two-year gap

1034
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,946
in my employment history.

1035
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:04,997
You don't have
to do that.

1036
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:07,032
My husband passed away.

1037
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:09,335
My children were grown.

1038
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,537
I had no purpose,
I felt alone,

1039
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:16,041
and I started
having panic attacks.

1040
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:18,294
And why would I need
to know that?

1041
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:22,131
Because I don't
have them anymore.

1042
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:27,469
Good night, Gretchen.

1043
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:30,022
What was that all about?

1044
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:31,974
Getting to know
my new secretary.

1045
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:32,975
Did you come by
just to brag

1046
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:34,560
about helping me with Jack?

1047
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:36,478
I take it that means
he backed down.

1048
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,697
Like Roberto Durn
against Sugar Ray.

1049
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:40,032
<i>No ms.</i>

1050
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:42,067
Seriously...

1051
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,152
you okay?

1052
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:47,072
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks.

1053
00:40:47,124 --> 00:40:48,624
Want to get a bite
or something?

1054
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:49,825
Sure.

1055
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:51,160
I got to warn you,
my stomach's still full

1056
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:52,594
from my lunch
with Robert Zane.

1057
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,996
Oh, we're lunching now,
are we?

1058
00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:55,331
Why, you jealous?

1059
00:40:55,383 --> 00:40:57,499
No, I just thought
you guys were working a case,

1060
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:58,834
not picnicking in a park.

1061
00:40:58,886 --> 00:41:00,252
Let me tell you,
it was no picnic.

1062
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,720
You ever try to go
toe-to-toe with that guy

1063
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:03,172
over all-you-can-eat shrimp?

1064
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:05,224
<i>No ms.</i>

1065
00:41:06,677 --> 00:41:08,927
Hey, give me
a few minutes.

1066
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,814
I gotta take care
of something.

1067
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:20,072
* *

1068
00:41:20,107 --> 00:41:22,992
You ever take sides with
Jack Soloff against me again,

1069
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:25,077
I will bury you.
