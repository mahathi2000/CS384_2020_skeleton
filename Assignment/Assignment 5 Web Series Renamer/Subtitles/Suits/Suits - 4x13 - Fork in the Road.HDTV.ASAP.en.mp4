1
00:00:01,326 --> 00:00:02,646
And you got your name
on the wall.

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,351
Now I want the respect
that comes with it.

3
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:05,496
Meaning?

4
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:06,580
I want one
of Harvey's clients.

5
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:08,248
My clients are my clients,

6
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,773
and if you don't get out
of my office

7
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,918
in the next three seconds,

8
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:12,722
something's gonna happen
between you and me,

9
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:14,722
and I guarantee
it won't end with you

10
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:16,340
keeping all of your teeth.

11
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:17,925
Avery McKernon
was the first client

12
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:19,393
I ever brought
into the firm.

13
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:20,928
And they win,
like me.

14
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:24,014
They know Trevor
isn't in the class,

15
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,934
so they know he couldn't have
been the one to steal the test.

16
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,428
I'm not going to expel
your friend.

17
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:29,737
Thank you, sir.
I--

18
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:31,188
There's just one thing.
I'm gonna call Harvard.

19
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:34,241
Believe me when I tell you
you're never going there.

20
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:36,410
Remember this?
No, you don't.

21
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:38,568
Because you can't remember
something you never knew.

22
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:39,730
You can't fire me.

23
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,471
Why would I fire you
when I can break you?

24
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:46,036
You see, I'm going to bury you
under a mountain of shit so big,

25
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,122
you're going to be begging me
to take it off.

26
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:56,713
First of all,
give me that Manhattan

27
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,799
and go get yourself a drink
a man would order.

28
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,217
Come back here
in 15 minutes,

29
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:02,886
and if I still remember
who you are, I'll be shocked.

30
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:08,225
Okay, so why are
we really here?

31
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,561
I mean, you didn't just bring me
out to talk about Khaleesi.

32
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,230
I did. Paul Porter says
I look like her translator.

33
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,531
He's a Throner?

34
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:16,369
Though he says
I'm a less-attractive version

35
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,484
of her translator.

36
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,069
Okay, you're just trying
to get me to say

37
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:20,274
that you're hotter than her.

38
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,738
- Am I?
- You're way hotter.

39
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:23,574
But she has
that accent.

40
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:24,875
Fair point.

41
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:29,296
You know, look, the reason
that I brought you here

42
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:31,915
is to tell you that I know
that you told Louis

43
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,634
that I got Katrina a job.

44
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,254
- Look, I --
- Relax, I'm not mad at you.

45
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,089
But I do remember you
being the person

46
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,424
who told me
not to force things

47
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:41,425
that weren't meant to be.

48
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:44,344
Rachel, just because
a person gives advice

49
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:46,589
doesn't mean that they have
to follow that same advice.

50
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:48,238
That's one of the core
principles outlined

51
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,017
in "The Book of Donna."

52
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,019
Seriously, though,
I didn't mean to tell Louis.

53
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:53,737
It just came out.
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,355
Like I said, it's fine.

55
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,858
He actually ended up asking
if we could be friends again.

56
00:01:57,942 --> 00:01:59,193
And?

57
00:01:59,277 --> 00:02:02,579
And I told him that things would
never be the same between us

58
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:04,114
unless he forgave Mike.

59
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,499
And what did he say?

60
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:08,669
He said he couldn't do it.

61
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:10,621
That's easy.
The jumper over Ehlo.

62
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,791
Wrong, the switch-hand layup
over Perkins and Green.

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,079
I'm surprised
at you, Harvey.

64
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:17,628
The Ehlo jumper
was a game-winner.

65
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:18,962
The layup was a statement.

66
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,465
"I can do whatever I want.
I own this league."

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,134
Are you talking about Jordan
or yourself now?

68
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,136
Is there a difference?

69
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,638
A big difference,

70
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,641
which brings me
to why I'm here.

71
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:32,776
You can't do
whatever you want, Harvey.

72
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,812
You want me to make things right
with Louis.

73
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:37,531
He made things right
between Jeff and me.

74
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:40,234
So I'm supposed to kiss his ass
forever because of that?

75
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,486
No, you're supposed
to make peace.

76
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,489
Jessica, I'm willing
to make peace,

77
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:46,733
but that's
never gonna happen.

78
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,991
Why not?

79
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,127
Because Louis
is never gonna forgive Mike.

80
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:53,330
Then figure out a way
to make him forgive Mike.

81
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:03,340
Donna, how many times
have I told you

82
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,508
I want you out front?

83
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:06,343
I'm the only associate
with a secretary.

84
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,437
It would be nice if people
could see my secretary.

85
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,513
Well, then maybe your next
secretary can figure out

86
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,184
where to put this
without coming into your office.

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,103
- You're kidding?
- Not kidding.

88
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:17,354
You didn't forge this?

89
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:19,406
I am a lot of things,
but I am not a monster.

90
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,692
I would do that
to neither Michael nor you.

91
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:23,944
- Oh, so he's Michael now?
- Well, I'm Donna to him.

92
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,863
He's Michael to me, which
is what I told His Airness

93
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,081
when he called.

94
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,250
Wait a second.
You're not kidding.

95
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:31,368
He signed with me?

96
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:32,892
Well, technically,
he signed with me.

97
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:35,756
Holy shit, Donna.
We have to celebrate tonight.

98
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:37,374
Oh, I'm gonna celebrate.

99
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,459
You, on the other hand,
are having drinks with Louis.

100
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:41,712
What?
We've been over this.

101
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,880
Whenever Louis asks
to have drinks with me,

102
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:44,965
the answer's always no.

103
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,801
Listen to the words
that I'm saying.

104
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,053
You are getting drinks
with Louis tonight.

105
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:51,939
Fairchild's retiring?

106
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:54,391
Fairchild's dead.

107
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,075
That's almost as good
as the Jordan news.

108
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,194
Eh, not to Fairchild.

109
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:58,528
Who gives a shit
about Fairchild?

110
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,653
The real tragedy is
I have to get drinks with Louis.

111
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,418
Which is why I got you
a secluded restaurant

112
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,484
with a table in the back
where no one will see you.

113
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,404
And you'll call a half an hour
in and say there's an emergency.

114
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:09,573
Already in place,
and if I can't get through,

115
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,875
then I'll just have the waiter
spill drinks all over Louis.

116
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:13,410
- You could have that done?
- Oh, please.

117
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:14,778
I could have Louis
held captive

118
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,463
in a Tibetan monastery
if I wanted to.

119
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:17,998
Yeah, I don't think
you have that--

120
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,482
Now get the hell out
of your office.

121
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:20,584
I got work to do.

122
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,506
Hmm.

123
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,683
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where Jim O'Donnell's office is?

124
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,935
That depends. What do you know
about immigration law?

125
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,104
What, are we talking visas,
or are you trying to process

126
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,606
a labor certification?

127
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,274
You know about
immigration law?

128
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:46,443
Doesn't everybody?

129
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,945
Okay, tough guy,

130
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,782
what do you think
about my strategy on this?

131
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,419
Hmm.

132
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,454
- I think it's a winner.
- Why is that?

133
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,788
Because everyone knows Gonzalez
versus State of Maryland

134
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:02,626
was a kick-ass precedent,
but your case is better.

135
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,544
It was
a kick-ass precedent,

136
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:06,189
but I'm not sure that my case
is better.

137
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:07,214
Oh, it is.

138
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:08,181
Well, what
about Viteri versus--

139
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:09,516
Trust me, it's better.

140
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:13,353
Viteri needed magic dust
and a sympathetic judge to win.

141
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:15,272
- Have we met?
- Nope.

142
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,940
But I'm Mike,
by the way.

143
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,025
Claire.

144
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,122
Are you sure?
Because you look very familiar.

145
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,449
Oh, that's probably because
I've been delivering packages

146
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:26,983
to your office
for the last two months.

147
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:28,668
but you haven't given me
the time of day,

148
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:31,988
because you didn't think I was
smart enough for you.

149
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:33,824
It's 915.

150
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,659
Wait.
That worked?

151
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,461
It's working so far,
but I'm gonna need to know

152
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,225
your full story
if it's gonna keep working.

153
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,380
Well, I'll tell you
the full story

154
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:41,665
once you give me
your phone number.

155
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:43,500
I'll give you my number
when I know the full story.

156
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:46,720
How about this? I'll tell you
everything you want to know

157
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:48,255
at dinner tomorrow night.

158
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:53,510
In that case, I'll show you
where Jim O'Donnell's office is.

159
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,929
Jim O'Donnell's office?

160
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,398
Where do you think
I just came from?

161
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,361
I need you do something
for me.

162
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,529
Okay, what is it?

163
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,247
Never mind what it is.

164
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,283
Unless you want to go back
to whatever you were doing

165
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,618
before I hired you,
you'll be here at 9:00 a.m.

166
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:21,371
This is the address
for your car club.

167
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:22,622
Oh, yeah, your memory.

168
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,758
I'd remember this
even if I had your memory.

169
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:26,596
It was right before
our first case together.

170
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,261
You're right,
McKernon Motors.

171
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:31,381
So this time be on time
and put your seat belt on,

172
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:33,717
because we're about to take
a trip down memory lane.

184
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,502
Morning, sunshine.

185
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,375
- What are you --
- I think you call it a prunie.

186
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,127
Congratulations, Donna told you
my favorite breakfast drink,

187
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,013
but what does that have to do
with the price of tea

188
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,130
in Antarctica?

189
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:29,882
Donna also told me
that you were pissed,

190
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,851
because you found out
I gave you a client

191
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,469
I didn't want
in the first place.

192
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,187
Hmm. And you think this is gonna
make up for that?

193
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:38,557
No, but I think giving you 50%
of McKernon Motors will.

194
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:40,977
What's the catch?

195
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,980
The catch is, you and I
are about to take a road trip

196
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:46,649
to their corporate headquarters
right now.

197
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:49,902
You serious?

198
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,787
I don't joke
about McKernon Motors,

199
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,706
and you know that as well
as I do.

200
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,494
To Fairchild.

201
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,330
To Fairchild.
God rest his soul.

202
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:02,965
Screw his soul.

203
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,668
You know how they say
"Heaven just got another angel"?

204
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:08,721
They ain't saying it now.

205
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,339
Why do you keep checking
your phone?

206
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:13,342
- No reason. I just--
- Please, I'm not an idiot.

207
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,144
We've been here 28 minutes,
and in 2 minutes,

208
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,263
Donna's gonna call
with some preplanned emergency.

209
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:18,681
Louis, that's not --

210
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:21,100
Look, why do you think I used
Fairchild's retirement

211
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,401
to get you to have drinks
with me?

212
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,439
Because you knew I thought
it would never happen?

213
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,088
Because he doesn't have
an heir apparent.

214
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,108
Louis, if you're thinking
what I think you're thinking--

215
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,243
Hardman's not gonna make
one of us senior partner.

216
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,029
I'm not talking
about one of us.

217
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:35,281
I'm talking about both of us
convincing Hardman

218
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,333
that two kick-ass
junior partners are worth

219
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,920
as much as one new
senior partner.

220
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,540
Louis, that is the best idea
you've had since I've known you.

221
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,876
Yeah?

222
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:48,878
Here's another one.

223
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:55,711
When did you come up
with this one?

224
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:56,886
When you were in the bathroom
wasting 7 minutes

225
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,887
of our half hour.

226
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,808
Don't you have
to get that?

227
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:04,610
No, I don't.

228
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,062
Let's drink to this.

229
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,567
Asshole.

230
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,987
That was Donna,
wasn't it?

231
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,623
Trevor,
this is so stupid.

232
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:18,781
It's not stupid, dickhead.

233
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,076
I want you to see it
for the first time

234
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,327
from the middle
of the room.

235
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:23,245
It's your apartment,
assface,

236
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:26,082
and don't even think about
giving me a wet Willie.

237
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:27,750
You suck the fun
out of everything.

238
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,418
Go ahead.
Open your eyes, dickfoot.

239
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:31,053
- "Dickfoot"?
- I was gonna use "assface."

240
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,178
It's all I could think of.

241
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:33,506
How do you even manage
in the world?

242
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,974
Are you just gonna stand there
with your your eyes closed

243
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:36,392
and mock my "dickfoot"?

244
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,676
I'm definitely not gonna
open them to see your dickfoot.

245
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,429
That's a good point.
I wouldn't do that either.

246
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:41,680
Go ahead.
Open your eyes.

247
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,569
Wow.
Holy shit.

248
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,320
I thought you were getting
a studio.

249
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:51,107
Yeah, I was going to,
but then I realized

250
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:55,327
we can't both live
in a studio.

251
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:56,445
What?

252
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,831
Welcome
to Casa Evans and Ross.

253
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,916
Trevor, I can't afford
half this rent.

254
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,001
That's the best part.

255
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,285
Don't worry about it.

256
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,980
I'm gonna pay
for your whole first year.

257
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,422
No, you're not.
I can't let you do that.

258
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,290
Michael, I start my new job
on Tuesday.

259
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:10,505
On top of that, I have
my friends and family business

260
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:11,961
on the side.

261
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,462
That doesn't mean I'm gonna
take charity from you.

262
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:14,957
Look, are you gonna
make me say it?

263
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:17,216
It's not charity.

264
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,467
I graduated,
and you didn't,

265
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:21,103
because you took the fall
for something I did.

266
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,505
I owe you.

267
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,478
Okay, I'll think about it.

268
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:31,814
All right, in the meantime,
think about this.

269
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:33,399
Ahh...
no, I can't.

270
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:34,900
- I got a date tonight.
- All right.

271
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,903
Wow, clubfoot, mustache,
all of the above?

272
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:40,789
First dickfoot
and then clubfoot?

273
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,908
Are words with "foot"
all you've got now?

274
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,995
All right, smart guy, describe
her with one of your SAT words.

275
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:48,464
- Bigfoot.
- That's what I'm talking about.

276
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:53,419
For the record,
she's really hot.

277
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:56,839
Let me get this straight.

278
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,573
Instead of promoting
an existing partner,

279
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:01,510
you want me to make both of you
junior partners.

280
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,262
Well, not make us.
We've earned it.

281
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,148
Earned partnership status?

282
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,851
That's a pretty bold statement
coming from two fifth-years.

283
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:10,186
Not just any fifth-years.

284
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:12,353
We're the best fifth-years
this firm has ever seen,

285
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:13,522
and you know it.

286
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:15,574
May I inquire whose idea
this was?

287
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:17,193
- It was both of ours.
- I was Louis'.

288
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,477
That's generous of you

289
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,695
to give him credit.

290
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:23,449
It was generous of him to come
to me with the idea.

291
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,418
The truth is, I wasn't
gonna make anyone partner.

292
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,538
But I do like admire
your gumption.

293
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:33,209
So here's
what I'm willing to do.

294
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:36,378
I will advance one of you
if you prove to me

295
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:38,380
which one it should be.

296
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:39,755
No, see,
that's the whole point.

297
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,433
We came in
as a package deal.

298
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:42,851
You came in
with a proposal.

299
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,138
I'm giving you a counter,
and it's take it or leave it.

300
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,857
What sort of proof
are we talking about?

301
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,977
Let's just say McKernon Motors
is in play,

302
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,980
and landing them could go
a long way to making your case.

303
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:56,398
No way.
We're not gonna--

304
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,933
All right, Daniel.

305
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,119
You want McKernon?

306
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:02,454
I'll get you McKernon.

307
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:07,826
We're going to McKernon Motors,
not your senior prom.

308
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,378
Why can't we just take
the car service?

309
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,547
Because we're going to
an engine manufacturer.

310
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,416
We need to show up

That's no good.

Why the hell not?

314

You said you and I
are going up there.

You lied to me.

319

Because if I didn't, you would
have never agreed to come.

There is no way

Yes, you are.

I don't care if I have
to tie you to the roof.

By the time we get
to McKernon,

324
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,106
you and Mike are gonna
work your shit out.

325
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:54,749
I can't believe
you did that.

326
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,034
The plan was to present
a united front.

00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,552
And we did,
and he didn't go for it.

I didn't stab you in the back.
I took what he gave us.

330
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,958
He didn't give us
anything, Harvey.

331

He pitted us

are gonna make partner?

- I still haven't received--
- This year's budget?

I was just on my way
to give it to you.

405
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,398
And I thought maybe you hadn't
gotten around to it

406
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,676
because you were too busy
pitting Harvey against Louis.

You disapprove.

408
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,488
I don't mind a little
healthy competition.

409
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,823
But I do mind the empty promise
of partnership.

410
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,981
What makes you so sure
there's no reward at the end?

411
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:26,233
The last time
we discussed this,

412
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,398
you said Harvey
wasn't ready.

413
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,662
And you said Louis wasn't.

414
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,740
Well, I'm giving them both
the chance to prove it.

415
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:32,032
So partnership
is on the table.

416
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,869
Partnership was already
on the table.

417
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,088
What makes you so sure
it's gonna be Harvey?

418
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,207
Because Harvey will do
whatever it takes to win.

419
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,376
If doing whatever it takes
is the criteria,

420
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,012
my money is on Louis.

there's no one on this planet

just point me towards

430
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:13,207
Kumquat McGillicuddy's office,
I'll be on my way,

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,910
You're cocky.

466
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,045
I'm right.

467
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,603
You're also traveling
a little light.

468
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:44,748
Where's your
PowerPoint presentation?

469
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,967
I don't need
a PowerPoint presentation.

470
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,252
Why is that?

471
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,804
Because every lawyer in the city
has tried to dazzle you,

472
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,224
and you're still looking
for a date to the big dance,

473
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:57,228
because they don't know
what you're looking for.

474
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:59,597
What exactly
am I looking for?

475
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,599
Loyalty.

476
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,519
You're right.

477
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,155
I built this company
from the ground up,

478
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,357
and everybody that started
with me is still here.

479
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,609
And I know why.

480
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,110
You don't downsize
in the bad times.

481
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:15,079
They stick with you
in the good times.

482
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:17,448
And no other lawyer
has figured that out.

483
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:18,782
Not a single one.

484
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,201
Well, I'm the one, Avery,

485
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,753
which is why I know
you don't want me dumping you

486
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:25,122
for a bigger client
down the line.

487
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:27,708
How do I know you won't
do that?

488
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,211
Because that's not the way
I work.

489
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,129
Well, it's a hell
of a nice sentiment.

490
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,265
but how do I know you're not
full of shit?

491
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,133
I'm glad you asked,

492
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:40,804
because here's my
PowerPoint presentation.

493
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,954
Okay...

494
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,908
I have a hearing tomorrow
against Fletcher Engines.

495
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:03,460
You win that,
you're my lawyer.

496
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,702
Ok, just don't change lanes.

497
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:13,578
Don't change lanes.

498
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:15,637
Don't do this. Great.
Okay, you know what?

499
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:17,806
This is ridiculous.
You drive like a savage animal.

500
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,391
Louis, be a man
and suck it up.

501
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:21,226
Suck it up?
I'm sitting in the death seat.

502
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,562
Fine. I'll pull over, and you
can sit in the back with Mike.

503
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:25,446
Hey, I'm not sitting in the back
with a fraud,

504
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:27,649
and before you even think it,
you're not putting him up here

505
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:28,813
and sticking me back there.

506
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,035
Then what do
you want, Louis?

507
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:31,369
Because there
is no way in hell

508
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:33,038
I'm letting you
behind the wheel of this car.

509
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:35,373
It's crystal goddamn clear.

510
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:37,459
You and I sit in the back, and
he chauffeurs the both of us.

511
00:20:37,577 --> 00:20:39,828
Whoa, no. Even if Harvey would
agree to that, which I doubt--

512
00:20:39,962 --> 00:20:41,046
Shut the hell up.

513
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:42,497
You're not talking.
You don't get to refuse.

514
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:45,667
I'm not refusing, Louis.
I don't know how to drive.

515
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:49,337
Holy shit.

516
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:56,595
You wanted to see me?

517
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:58,063
Uh, yes.

518
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,015
I heard you did well
with Avery McKernon.

519
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:02,067
Well,
then you heard wrong,

520
00:21:02,184 --> 00:21:04,352
because I killed it
with Avery McKernon.

521
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:07,072
- Congratulations, Harvey.
- Thank you, Daniel.

522
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:09,074
You're welcome.

523
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,859
Unfortunately,
we can't represent

524
00:21:10,993 --> 00:21:12,277
McKernon Motors after all.

525
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:13,662
Why not?

526
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:15,196
Well, it turns out
Fletcher Engines

527
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:16,748
wants to sign with us.

528
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:19,084
Because they found out
I'm about to land McKernon.

529
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:22,254
Yes, and they're three times
the size of McKernon Motors

530
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:23,922
Well, I don't care
how big they are.

531
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,341
I'm not dropping
my client.

532
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:28,593
Yes, you are.

533
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,048
This was your plan
all along.

534
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,300
Of course it was.
That's how the world works.

535
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:37,302
I don't give a shit
how the world works.

536
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:39,387
I gave my word
to Avery McKernon.

537
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:40,855
Watch yourself, Harvey.

538
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:43,141
I haven't gotten where I am
by watching myself, Daniel.

539
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:45,777
And I don't appreciate
being used as a stalking horse.

540
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:49,698
Well, you may not appreciate it,
but let me remind you,

541
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:51,149
you work for me.

542
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:55,620
And I'm giving you the chance
to show me you understand that.

543
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:58,790
Let me remind you you said
partnership was on the table.

544
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:01,793
I'm gonna hold you to that,
and so will Jessica.

545
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:12,470
Hey, fart taster.

546
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:15,557
I thought you were
coming over.

547
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:17,559
What, nothing?
It's a classic.

548
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:19,344
I'm implying your job
is to literally taste--

549
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:21,148
Hey, Trevor,
I'm in the middle of something,

550
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,814
so I'll come over
later, okay?

551
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:24,566
In the middle of what?

552
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,568
That girl
I told you about,

553
00:22:26,652 --> 00:22:28,486
she interns
at a legal clinic,

554
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:30,655
and I am helping her
with a case.

555
00:22:30,773 --> 00:22:31,856
Dickfoot
gave you homework?

556
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:35,110
Okay, first of all, from now on,
her name is Claire.

557
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:37,612
And second of all,
this is important, so...

558
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:40,832
Dude, what the hell
are you talking about?

559
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:47,288
I might have told her
that I'm in law school.

560
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:49,374
Holy shit.

561
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,959
You will do anything
to get laid.

562
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:52,510
I am not trying
to get laid.

563
00:22:52,628 --> 00:22:55,213
I really like this girl,
and I have zero chance with her

564
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:56,631
if all I am
is a bike messenger.

565
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,726
Yeah, well, you're definitely
gonna have no chance

566
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:00,301
if she finds out
that you lied to her.

567
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:03,555
Trevor, I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

568
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:06,891
You don't really want to talk
about anything anymore.

569
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,863
It's about the apartment,
isn't it?

570
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:14,482
- Yes it's about the apartment.
- Okay, you want the truth?

571
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:16,518
I haven't given you an answer
because of Grammy.

572
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:17,772
You think
I didn't know that?

573
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,300
Then you know
she's never forgiven you

574
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:20,572
for what happened
in college,

575
00:23:20,656 --> 00:23:22,736
and she is never, ever going
to let me live with you.

576
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:24,743
Then explain to her
that this is my way

577
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:26,244
of making up for what I did
in college.

578
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:27,495
That is never gonna work.

579
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,547
You know what, Michael?

580
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:33,001
If you're gonna do all of this
for some girl you just met,

581
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:36,888
maybe it's time you stood up
to Grammy for me.

582
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,977
How'd it go
against Fletcher Engines?

583
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:45,180
You cut them off at the knees
or put them in the ground?

584
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,015
They put me in the ground,

585
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:49,517
and on top of that, it was
in front of Avery McKernon.

586
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:50,735
You lost in court?

587
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:54,239
I didn't just lose.
I looked like a fool.

588
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:55,356
Harvey, what happened?

589
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:57,242
The general counsel
for Fletcher Engines

590
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,527
knew every move I was gonna make
before I even made it.

591
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:00,662
How could he--

592
00:24:00,746 --> 00:24:02,580
Because Hardman
must have tipped him off.

593
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:04,018
You really think
he would do that?

594
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:06,367
I wouldn't have yesterday,
but I sure as hell do today.

595
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:08,203
Then you have to go
to Jessica.

596
00:24:08,337 --> 00:24:09,337
And say what?

597
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:11,756
Hardman's managing partner.
She's not.

598
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:13,875
I don't have any proof,
and I never will.

599
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,376
Well, then
what are you gonna do?

600
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:17,879
I don't know,
but I have less than 14 hours

601
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:20,215
to dig through 1,000 pages
of patent law.

602
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,768
If only there was somebody
in the office who was an expert

603
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:24,886
on patent law.

604
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,721
Donna,
I am not going to Louis.

605
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,223
He'll never help me.

606
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,470
Well, that's too bad,
because if you can't figure out

607
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:32,143
how to patch things up
with Louis,

608
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:34,195
then you don't deserve
Avery McKernon

609
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,531
or that partnership.

610
00:24:41,237 --> 00:24:44,789
What's all this?

611
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:48,576
Uh, a grandson can't order in
and set a table

612
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:50,578
for his grandmother?

613
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:52,163
A grandson can do
whatever he wants.

614
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:55,467
But the answer
to your question is no.

615
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:58,253
You haven't even heard
what it is yet.

616
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,255
I know what it is,
because I've been waiting for it

617
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:02,056
since that kid graduated,

618
00:25:02,174 --> 00:25:04,392
and you are not
gonna live with him.

619
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,012
That boy is the reason
you got kicked out of school.

620
00:25:08,097 --> 00:25:10,982
You're the one that told me
to tell the dean the truth.

621
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,401
That was before I knew
it would cost you graduating.

622
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:14,986
And he's trying
to make it up to me.

623
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:17,272
He's gonna pay for my whole
first year's rent.

624
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:20,158
That will not make up
for putting your whole life

625
00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:21,609
into a tailspin.

626
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,697
- It's a head start.
- No, it's not a head start!

627
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:25,363
That boy is gonna drag you
back down with him!

628
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:27,007
Grammy, I'm never gonna let
that happen!

629
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:29,367
God damn it!
I forbid it!

630
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:39,427
I'm sorry, Michael.
I lost my temper.

631
00:25:39,545 --> 00:25:42,931
But I know
what he does to you,

632
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:47,969
and I know he'll
always be the same.

633
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:50,355
Has it occurred to you
that maybe I'm not the same?

634
00:25:50,472 --> 00:25:52,640
What's changed?

635
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:54,526
I met someone.

636
00:25:56,812 --> 00:26:01,232
And I'm gonna figure out a way
to finish school, and...

637
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:03,484
and then I'm gonna go
to law school.

638
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:06,704
Good.

639
00:26:06,822 --> 00:26:09,040
Then do it from here

640
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:18,833
What's on your mind, Mike?

641
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,168
You look lost in thought.

642
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:24,422
I was just thinking
about my grandmother.

643
00:26:26,342 --> 00:26:30,178
We took a train trip
to D.C. once.

644
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:32,063
We played I Spy.

645
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:35,516
That's a nice story, Mike,
but we are not playing I Spy.

646
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:38,069
I'll play. It'll remind me of
dominating Esther on our trips

647
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,654
to see our smelly Aunt Frida.

648
00:26:39,738 --> 00:26:42,273
All right, if it will get
you and Mike talking, sure.

649
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:46,611
I spy a fraud who probably
never even knew his grandmother.

650
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:48,863
All right, God damn it,
you got a problem with me,

651
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:50,365
take it up with me,
but don't ever talk

652
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:51,666
about my grandmother again

653
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,368
Oh, I forgot,
the poor orphan

654
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:55,536
from New York City
who I should feel sorry for

655
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:56,704
because he never
learned to drive.

656
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,039
I'm telling you,
watch yourself.

657
00:26:58,173 --> 00:26:59,123
Why?
Because I hurt your feelings?

658
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:00,375
- Louis!
- I don't care.

659
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:02,093
For all I know, you're probably
not even an orphan.

660
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:04,379
It sure as hell wouldn't be
the first time a con man

661
00:27:04,513 --> 00:27:05,513
tried to make that claim.

662
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:06,787
- That's enough.
- No, it isn't.

663
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,132
Yes, it is.
Pull the car over right now.

664
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:10,051
I'm gonna beat the shit
out of him.

665
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:19,286
Hey, you got a minute?

666
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:20,670
Oh, wait.
let me turn my back,

667
00:27:20,787 --> 00:27:22,121
so I can give you the right
angle to---

668
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:24,507
You were right.
We should have stuck together.

669
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:27,793
I get it--
you need my help,

670
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:30,630
because you got your ass wiped
in court this morning.

671
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:33,432
You're right. I did get my ass
<i>kicked</i> this morning,

672
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:34,557
but it wasn't
a fair fight.

673
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:35,968
What are you talking about?

674
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:38,054
Hardman accessed
my computer

675
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:40,139
and fed the other side
my game plan.

676
00:27:40,307 --> 00:27:42,508
Okay, I'm still waiting
for the part

677
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:43,809
where I'm supposed
to give a shit.

678
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:46,229
Hardman did it because
I refused to dump McKernon

679
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:47,863
for Fletcher
after I gave him my word.

680
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:49,181
And why should I help you

681
00:27:49,316 --> 00:27:50,816
when you couldn't live up
to your word to me?

682
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:52,285
I did live up to my word.

683
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:53,986
- We went to Daniel--
- Oh, bullshit.

684
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:55,488
No,
it's not bullshit.

685
00:27:55,622 --> 00:27:57,456
I welcomed your idea
with open arms,

686
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:59,242
and by the way, when he asked
whose idea it was,

687
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:00,693
I gave you the credit.

688
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:03,462
You see, Harvey, that's the part
you will never understand.

689
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,748
I didn't want the credit.

690
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:07,083
I wanted us to be a team.

691
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,384
Then let's be a team
right now.

692
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:09,802
But you don't want
to be a team.

693
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,320
You want me to help you
get McKernon

694
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:12,638
so you can make partner.

695
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:15,558
I want you to help me so I can
keep my word to Avery McKernon.

696
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:19,011
And when I become partner,
I'll keep my word to you.

697
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:22,565
What the hell word is that?

698
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:24,600
That someday what you wrote
on that napkin

699
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:26,936
goes up
on the goddamn wall.

700
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:34,410
You seem to have done
a lot of work here, Mike.

701
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:35,611
Oh, it's no big deal.

702
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:37,079
It is a big deal.

703
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:40,416
Mike found a loophole
in the Immigration Act of 1975,

704
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:41,751
and it's gonna blow you away.

705
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:43,252
I don't know about that,

706
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,371
but it may help Hector Suarez
stay in the country.

707
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:46,706
That's great.

708
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:48,713
And you're more than welcome
to stay and watch.

709
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,377
Unfortunately, Claire, I need
you to run back to the office.

710
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:52,678
Marshall called in sick.

711
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:54,930
I need someone
to handle the walk-ins, so...

712
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:58,184
Okay.

713
00:28:58,268 --> 00:29:00,803
Call me.
Tell me how it goes.

714
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:03,439
Yeah.

715
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:11,637
What the hell are you doing?
That's--

716
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:13,208
Gonna keep Hector Suarez
in the country?

717
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,067
Yeah.

718
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:16,786
Yeah, nothing's gonna keep him
in the country.

719
00:29:16,903 --> 00:29:18,571
So what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna buy him some time

720
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:20,099
so he can get his affairs
in order,

721
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,791
and then I'm gonna give
his children a chance to stay.

722
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:24,293
I'm just--I'm--I'm sorry.

723
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:26,662
Are you jealous of me
and Claire or...

724
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:29,248
Hey, look, I'm not jealous,
and I was waiting

725
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:31,634
for her to leave to save you
the embarrassment.

726
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:32,635
The embarrassment of what?

727
00:29:32,753 --> 00:29:34,220
That's good work.

728
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:35,671
I'm not talking
about the work.

729
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:38,507
I'm talking about your
"bike messenger by day,

730
00:29:38,642 --> 00:29:39,892
law student by night"
bullshit.

731
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:42,016
All right, you don't know
what you're talking about.

732
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:43,335
What are you gonna
tell me next?

733
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,132
Your roommate is a stripper
who's in medical school?

734
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:49,652
Tell me right now--I call
Columbia, your story holds up.

735
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,439
That's what I thought.

736
00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:55,403
Forget who I am,
and take a look at that folder.

737
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:57,276
- This is a man's life.
- Don't touch me.

738
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:58,601
If you know
what's good for you,

739
00:29:58,612 --> 00:30:00,496
you'll stay the hell away
from Claire.

740
00:30:10,924 --> 00:30:11,924
Daniel...

741
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:14,543
Did you know
that some of these species

742
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:17,296
can live up to 200 years?

743
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:18,714
Fascinating.

744
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:23,219
Did you know Fletcher Engines
is picking up the pieces?

745
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:25,187
I guess congratulations
are in order.

746
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:26,639
I not here for a pat
on the back.

747
00:30:26,773 --> 00:30:28,474
I'm here to tell you
you're making me partner.

748
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:30,976
Partner?

749
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:33,729
I never said signing McKernon
was the key to making partner.

750
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:34,864
Yes, you--

751
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:36,821
All I said was landing them
could go a long way

752
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,150
toward making your case.

753
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:39,285
Bullshit.

754
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:41,070
You said partnership
was on the table.

755
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:42,905
And I said I was gonna
hold you to it.

756
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,490
And I'm going to right now.

757
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:48,544
You don't hold me
to anything.

758
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:56,051
But I did say partnership
was on the table, and it is...

759
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:58,504
just not for you.

760
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:01,257
What are you talking about?

761
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:03,058
Well, I can't very well
make you partner

762
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:05,261
after I just told Louis
I'm making him partner.

763
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:07,680
What?

764
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:10,683
You don't get it,
do you?

765
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:13,269
This isn't about
bringing in business.

766
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:15,634
This is about figuring out
who would do whatever it takes.

767
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:17,356
I did whatever it took.

768
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:18,891
You didn't do a thing.

769
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:21,777
You had the chance
to triple our business,

770
00:31:21,862 --> 00:31:24,113
and all you had to do
was take a knee.

771
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:26,031
You mean bend a knee.

772
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:30,169
Yes, that's exactly
what I mean.

773
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:32,204
But you're
an arrogant little boy

774
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:34,256
who would rather win
than get in line.

775
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:38,878
Well, what the hell did Louis do
to get in line?

776
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:41,764
He did whatever it took.

777
00:31:56,696 --> 00:31:58,147
- Please get away from me.
- Claire, wait.

778
00:31:58,281 --> 00:32:00,366
- Nathan told me everything.
- Just let me explain, okay?

779
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,784
No, explain what--
that you're a sociopath?

780
00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:02,952
I'm not a sociopath.

781
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:04,403
I'm the same guy that you
hit it off with.

782
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:05,788
No, you're not.
You lied to me.

783
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:07,623
Yes, I am, and I didn't mean
to lie to you, okay?

784
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:08,824
I was gonna tell you
the truth.

785
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:11,460
Then why didn't you?

786
00:32:11,578 --> 00:32:13,629
Because you said you wanted
to be with a guy who was doing

787
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:15,998
something good with his life,
and I wasn't.

788
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:18,417
So what, now you're here to
tell me that all of a sudden,

789
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:20,432
you want to dedicate your life
to helping people

790
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:21,971
or some other lie like that?

791
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:24,590
It's not a lie, and what I did
would have helped Hector Suarez.

792
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:26,425
Yeah,
but you only did it--

793
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:28,113
Claire, please,
you have to believe me.

794
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:30,813
After I met you, I decided
to get my shit together.

795
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:32,515
I am trying to get
my shit together.

796
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,567
Okay, Mike,
you know what I hate more

797
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:37,403
than guys who don't have
their shit together?

798
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:40,573
It's guys who lie about
getting their shit together.

799
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:47,329
Claire.

800
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:55,120
Louis, fill up the tank.
I'll be back.

801
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:04,380
Well?

802
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:05,548
Well, what?

803
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:08,050
You heard what he said.
Fill up the tank.

804
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:09,468
Yeah,
I did hear what he said.

805
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:11,971
He said,
"Louis, fill up the tank."

806
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:16,642
Well, where I come from, it's
people who didn't go to college

807
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:17,943
who fill up gas tanks.

808
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:19,108
Yeah,
and where I come from,

809
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:20,585
if you take another step
towards me--

810
00:33:20,647 --> 00:33:22,147
Oh, what, the tough kid from
the city is gonna beat my ass?

811
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:23,699
Louis, I'm telling you
right now...

812
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,489
You ruined my life.
You ruined my firm.

813
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,876
Louis!

814
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,705
You son of a bitch.

815
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,873
Wait.
Harvey--

816
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,341
Tell me right now
you weren't the one

817
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:06,211
that gave Fletcher Engines
my game plan.

818
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:09,297
Hardman told me he wasn't gonna
make you partner anyway.

819
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:11,099
And once he offered it to me,
all I had to do was--

820
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,551
Sell me out.

821
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,520
How is what I did any different
than you going after

822
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:17,305
McKernon Motors
in the first place?

823
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,225
If you don't understand that
on your own, you never will.

824
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,727
So, from now on, you stay
on your side of the yard.

825
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:25,397
- I'll stay on mine.
- No, Harvey, listen to me.

826
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,399
You told me you would fight
to get our names on the wall

827
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,733
once you got
on the other side.

828
00:34:28,868 --> 00:34:30,235
I can do the same for you.

829
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,620
Did you hear
what I just said?

830
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,321
I don't want you
doing shit for me.

831
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,906
Oh, so it would be okay
if you were the one

832
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,208
who got there first?

833
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,959
It would have been okay
if you got there first

834
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:39,461
fair and square,

835
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,663
because then I would have
believed you

836
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,415
when you said you wanted
to be a team.

837
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:44,916
I do want to be a team,
Harvey.

838
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,251
That's why
I helped you after.

839
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,553
No, you don't!

840
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:49,804
You don't want to be a team.

841
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,640
You just want to have it
both ways,

842
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,225
because you're
a disloyal rat.

843
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,982
You always have been,
and you always will,

844
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,429
no matter what it says
on your door.

845
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,055
Well, like you said, we've been
pitted against each other

846
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:03,935
since day one.

847
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,657
You asked how many of the
50 associates we started with

848
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,442
would make partner.

849
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:11,576
Well, you know what?

850
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:12,994
I don't give a shit
about the other 49,

851
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,413
because I'm the one
who did.

852
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:18,199
I'm the one who did.

853
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:19,751
And now get the hell
out of my face,

854
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:20,952
because I have work to do.

855
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,272
You know he did that
on purpose, right?

856
00:35:40,356 --> 00:35:41,806
Did what on purpose?

857
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,809
He asked you to fill the tank
because he knew what you'd do.

858
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,895
Knew what I would do?
What about what you would do?

859
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:51,483
He knew that too.

860
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,319
Louis...

861
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,321
You never even said
you were sorry.

862
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,714
I am sorry, Louis.

863
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,233
I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

864
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:13,171
I'm not a con man,
Louis.

865
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:17,559
Every single other thing
I ever told you was true.

866
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,320
Want to know something that I've
never even admitted to myself?

867
00:36:33,576 --> 00:36:35,296
I never learned to drive
for the same reason

868
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:38,363
I never went to law school.

869
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,032
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident.

870
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:44,919
And ever since then,
I've never been able to--

871
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,422
Get behind the wheel.

872
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:53,094
And then Harvey gave me
a license, and I took it.

873
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,684
You were 11 years old.

874
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:05,940
I mean, you must have felt
so alone.

875
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:10,147
I thought you said you
didn't believe I was an orphan.

876
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:16,067
I looked it up.

877
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:18,512
I had to once I found out that
you never went to law school.

878
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:21,322
You mean once you found out
that I'm a fraud.

879
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,124
You're not a fraud, Mike.

880
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,712
You just never went
to law school.

881
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,550
Okay, Frazier,
you get a grape.

882
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,971
Ali, I got you
a fruit punch.

883
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,559
You two work
your shit out?

884
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,897
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's get the hell out of here.

885
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:02,280
I should never have lied
to her.

886
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:03,415
Oh, screw her, man.

887
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,666
If she doesn't like you
for who you are,

888
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:05,917
she doesn't deserve you.

889
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:07,702
It's not Claire's fault.
It's mine.

890
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,871
I know you were into her
and everything,

891
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:11,289
but trust me,

892
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,924
there are plenty of other fish
in the sea.

893
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:14,092
You don't know that.

894
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,543
For all you know,
I'm never gonna meet

895
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:16,708
another girl
like her again.

896
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,046
Michael--

897
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,564
Trevor, if I'm gonna have
to listen

898
00:38:19,682 --> 00:38:20,932
to whatever
you're about to say,

899
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,467
I'm gonna need
a joint first.

900
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:24,636
Come on, I thought you were
trying to turn your life around.

901
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,305
I'll turn my life around
tomorrow.

902
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,441
But tonight
I'm a bike messenger, so...

903
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,359
- Dude--
- Trevor.

904
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:35,447
All right.

905
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:38,650
Fine.

906
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,318
And I know Grammy
doesn't want you living here,

907
00:38:40,453 --> 00:38:42,904
but you can crash here tonight
if you want.

908
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:56,885
Donna.

909
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,137
Something wrong?

910
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:00,722
Why would something
be wrong?

911
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,509
Because I don't believe you've
ever been in my office before.

912
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,178
No, nothing's wrong.

913
00:39:07,313 --> 00:39:08,680
And I know
it's not my place,

914
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:11,149
but I'm here to tell you that
I think you're making a mistake.

915
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:16,104
Is this about me not giving
people off for Columbus Day?

916
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,606
You know this isn't
about that.

917
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:20,692
Harvey laid it on the line
with Daniel,

918
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,243
and you didn't have
his back.

919
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:25,830
Donna, I've had Harvey's back
since the day I met him.

920
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,665
For your information,
when I found out

921
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,034
what Daniel was up to,
I had him guarantee

922
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:31,452
partnership
was on the table.

923
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:33,337
And then you let him give it
to the wrong man.

924
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,106
That is on Harvey,
not on me.

925
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,341
What are you talking about?

926
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:40,962
Daniel was worried
that Harvey couldn't put

927
00:39:41,096 --> 00:39:43,381
the firm's best interests
ahead of his own,

928
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:45,266
and Harvey
proved him right.

929
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,218
Or maybe you're just
telling yourself that

930
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,888
because you don't want
to stand up to Daniel Hardman.

931
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:53,858
Donna, there's a reason
why you are where you are

932
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:55,503
and I am where I am,
and that is because

933
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,979
one of us sees
the bigger picture.

934
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,484
You knew
about Fletcher Engines?

935
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:06,454
What I know is that
Harvey's time will come.

936
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,324
And if this little incident gets
him to think about other people

937
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:12,126
for a change,
then I'll take it.

938
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:20,835
You're up early.

939
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,306
I'm up early,
because I couldn't sleep.

940
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:29,093
Where we you all night?

941
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:31,729
You know where I was.

942
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,568
I was staying
at my new apartment.

943
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,436
I thought
we'd settled this.

944
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:40,939
You settled it.
I didn't.

945
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:44,826
I'm telling you, that kid--

946
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:46,424
Grammy, for as long
as I can remember,

947
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:47,946
you've been calling him
"that kid"

948
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,831
or "that boy"
or worse.

949
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:53,284
His name is Trevor.

950
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:56,037
And he's my best friend.

951
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,958
Look, I'm gonna do this thing
with our without your blessing,

952
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,793
but...

953
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:06,047
it sure would be nice
to have it.

954
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:09,867
Okay, Michael.

955
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:13,938
I'm not gonna lie to you
and pretend I approve,

956
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:16,774
but...

957
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:20,979
you're a grown man,
and I respect your decision.

958
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:29,821
I love you, Grammy.

959
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,323
I love you too.

960
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,413
Thank you.

961
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,465
I believe that's all
I need to know.

962
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:41,989
Thank you for your time,
Ms. Pearson.

963
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:45,586
I will wait
to hear from you.

964
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,008
Oh, one more thing--

965
00:41:50,142 --> 00:41:54,729
does your father know you came
to me for a job?

966
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:55,847
I-I--

967
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:57,168
Did you really think
I didn't know

968
00:41:57,232 --> 00:41:59,434
you were Robert Zane's
daughter?

969
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:02,520
Is that why
you're interviewing me?

970
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:03,738
Because if it is,

971
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:05,776
I would like to remove myself
from consideration.

972
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,109
If you don't want to work
for your father,

973
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:10,194
that's your business.

974
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:12,780
I'm hiring you
because I like what I see.

975
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:14,282
Hiring me?

976
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,834
You start Monday,
if that's not too much trouble.

977
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:18,586
I will be
the first one in.

978
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,461
Aren't you gonna ask me
why I don't want to work

979
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:27,595
with my father?

980
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,263
I know why.

981
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:31,099
I have a dad
just like yours.

982
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,300
He has his own law firm?

983
00:42:32,434 --> 00:42:34,218
He's a surgeon.

984
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:36,270
But it's
the same damn thing.

985
00:42:51,453 --> 00:42:53,204
- How are we on time?
- We're perfect.

986
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:54,882
But I'm not going in there.
You two are.

987
00:42:54,957 --> 00:42:56,824
What are you talking about?

988
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:58,292
I said I was giving you 50%
of McKernon.

989
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,795
I didn't say I was keeping
the other 50%.

990
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:04,916
Oh, so you finally realized
they need an upgrade

991
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:06,467
in representation.

992
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:07,752
Easy, Frazier.

993
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:09,566
You'd still be out cold
at that gas station

994
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:10,805
if I hadn't saved
your ass.

995
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:12,924
Okay, I would have gotten out...
eventually.

996
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,888
- Not from where I was standing.
- I'm slippery.

997
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:16,477
I told you--
I wrestled in high school.

998
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,346
- I checked on that. He did.
- See?

999
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,765
Oh, and now
you're fighting for him?

1000
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:22,517
Okay, I guess
my job here is done.

1001
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:23,818
Wait.
Where are you going?

1002
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:25,236
I'm taking the car back
to the city.

1003
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,388
Well, what the hell are we
supposed to do?

1004
00:43:27,412 --> 00:43:30,614
Ray's waiting on the other side
of the parking lot, isn't he?

1005
00:43:30,682 --> 00:43:32,416
He'll drive you two back
when you're done.

1006
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:34,301
Wait. You know what?
I have a better idea.

1007
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:36,020
How about you take Ray,
we take the car,

1008
00:43:36,104 --> 00:43:38,288
and I teach Mike how to drive
on the way home?

1009
00:43:38,423 --> 00:43:40,657
- You'd actually do that?
- Yeah, I would.

1010
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:42,543
- No way.
- You don't trust me?

1011
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,161
I don't trust you
as far as I can throw you.

1012
00:43:44,245 --> 00:43:45,379
You're a goddamn fraud.

1013
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,137
- That's what I said.
- Harvey, seriously.

1014
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:48,799
- Come on, I promise--
- Okay, I know you will.

1015
00:43:48,883 --> 00:43:50,584
Louis, you make one dent
in this car,

1016
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:52,919
Mike's back on the street,
and your name's off the door.

1017
00:43:57,175 --> 00:44:00,010
You think he was serious
about what he just said?

1018
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:01,812
Okay, well,
I'm just a little nervous,

1019
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,514
'cause I feel like I drank
that power drink,

1020
00:44:03,598 --> 00:44:04,732
and it has a lot
of sodium in it.

1021
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:06,517
Actually, it's like
drinking a hot dog,

1022
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:08,318
but the doctor says it raises
my blood pressure, so--

1023
00:44:08,403 --> 00:44:11,188
I'm gonna need you to let me do
the talking in there.
