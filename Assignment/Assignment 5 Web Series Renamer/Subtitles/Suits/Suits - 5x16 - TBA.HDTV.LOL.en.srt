1
00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:01,968
Previously on Suits...

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:04,071
Has ruined Clifford's life.

3
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:06,375
And if you had been our lawyer,

4
00:00:06,411 --> 00:00:08,912
he never would have been
convicted in the first place.

5
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:09,879
What do you want?

6
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:11,047
You do two years in prison,

7
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,649
and I won't go after
any of your friends.

8
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:14,250
It's the only sure
way to put this to bed

9
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:15,652
and make sure that the only person

10
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:17,120
who is hurt by it is me.

11
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:18,088
What about me?

12
00:00:18,123 --> 00:00:19,889
All I did was love you.

13
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:20,924
I'm not gonna rat them out.

14
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,191
I'm not asking you to.

15
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:24,127
I'm just asking you to
have faith in yourself.

16
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:25,228
Don't fall on your sword again.

17
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:26,262
We might not win.

18
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:27,597
You don't always have to be the hero.

19
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:29,265
I'm not doing it to be the hero.

20
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,767
Then why the hell are you doing it?

21
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:33,103
I would never send
my friends to prison.

22
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:34,403
They find me guilty,

23
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,439
they're gonna send my
friends to prison anyways.

24
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,360
The jury came back. We have an hour.

25
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:39,328
Where's Mike?

26
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:40,295
I don't know.

27
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,563
I'm ready to take your deal.

28
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:43,098
Which one?

29
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:47,130
So just to be clear,

30
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:48,965
this is the one you want to go with.

31
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:52,168
You go to prison for two
years, your friends go free,

32
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:53,704
and no crying about it once it's done.

33
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,138
One stipulation.

34
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:56,973
I'm not reducing your
jail time by one minute.

35
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:58,174
That's not it.

36
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,476
I want you to write
in that once we sign,

37
00:00:59,512 --> 00:01:01,512
you can't renegotiate with Harvey.

38
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:02,913
Oh, I get it.

39
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:04,314
You're afraid I'm gonna use this

40
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,716
to get him to take the bullet for you.

41
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:07,150
I'm not afraid of you
trying to do that,

42
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:08,419
because I know you will.

43
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:11,054
So, either put it in,
or we go to verdict.

44
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:13,156
And just remember, like you said to me...

45
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,531
What did you do?

46
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,333
I did what I had to do.

47
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,100
I pled guilty.

48
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:35,067
Bullshit.

49
00:01:35,103 --> 00:01:36,168
You didn't plead anything.

50
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:37,136
Harvey, look at me.

51
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,137
It was my crime.

52
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:39,105
It was my choice to make,

53
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,106
and I made it.

54
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,107
It's done.

55
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,308
Well, I'm gonna unmake it,

56
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:43,543
because the judge
hasn't ratified it yet,

57
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:45,278
and until she does, nothing is done.

58
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,579
Harvey, stop.

59
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:47,714
No, you listen to me.

60
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:49,081
If you think I'm gonna let you do this,

61
00:01:49,117 --> 00:01:51,217
you're out of your goddamn mind.

62
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:53,753
Do what, Mike?

63
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,455
What did you do?

64
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,023
I took the two years.

65
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,301
- No, no, you didn't.
- Rachel, Rachel, please.

66
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:01,768
- I don't accept that.
- Please listen.

67
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:02,769
It was the only way that I could...

68
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:05,097
No, it wasn't the only way.

69
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:07,264
You told me that you'd
wait for the verdict,

70
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,899
and I begged you to
have faith in yourself,

71
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:10,034
and you told me that you would.

72
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,568
That was before I begged
Diaz to take a deal

73
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:12,603
that would rat out his friend,

74
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:13,570
and he didn't listen to me...

75
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:14,906
Wait a second. You're throwing away

76
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:17,031
the next two years of our lives
for something that some criminal said?

77
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,685
- Just stop. Listen to me
- Hold on.

78
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:19,985
Harvey said he wasn't
gonna let this happen.

79
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,152
He went to see the judge, didn't he?

80
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:22,888
It doesn't matter. He can't stop it.

81
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:24,456
- Why not?
- Because it's not up to him.

82
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:26,592
It's up to me, and
I've made my decision.

83
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,090
Rachel, where are you going?

84
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,226
Anywhere else.

85
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:36,627
Because if you're gonna rob us

86
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:39,097
of the next two years of our lives,

87
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:42,133
I am not gonna stand here
and watch you do it.

88
00:02:46,754 --> 00:02:49,355
Ms. Gibbs, I don't
appreciate being kept waiting

89
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,290
once the jury has informed us
they've reached a verdict.

90
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:52,525
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

91
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,727
Mr. Ross and I were
finalizing a plea agreement.

92
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,195
I'm sorry too, Your Honor,

93
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,996
but they haven't finalized shit.

94
00:02:58,032 --> 00:02:59,865
What did you just say in my courtroom?

95
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,866
You heard what I said.

96
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:03,369
My chambers, right now.

97
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:08,837
Rachel, I heard the jury is back.

98
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:09,938
I came down to hear the verdict.

99
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,172
There's not gonna be a verdict,

100
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,473
so you can turn right around,

101
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,410
because Mike took a deal to
spend two years in prison.

102
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,478
Oh, my God.

103
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:19,683
And they're in there right
now signing off on it.

104
00:03:19,684 --> 00:03:20,849
And I don't know what to do.

105
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:23,317
Okay, I'll tell you
what you need to do.

106
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:24,385
You need to go back inside,

107
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,787
and you need to be there for him.

108
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,656
I'm not gonna go back
inside and be there for him.

109
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:28,723
Why not?

110
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,025
Because he told me that he wasn't

111
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,560
going to do this.

112
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:37,609
He told me that it was on the table,

113
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:39,211
and I begged him not to take it,

114
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:41,447
and he promised me that he wouldn't.

115
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:42,881
Rachel, last night Harvey came to me

116
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:43,983
wanting to do the same thing,

117
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,952
and I begged him to have
faith in that jury.

118
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:47,119
And Harvey kept his word.

119
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:48,587
But he might not have,

120
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,489
and I told myself that
if he changed his mind,

121
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:51,958
I would have to forgive him.

122
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:52,992
Then Donna,

123
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,693
you're a better woman than I am,

124
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:56,895
because Mike is my heart,

125
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,731
and right now I feel like
someone is ripping my heart

126
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:02,801
out of my chest, and that someone...

127
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:04,971
that someone's him.

128
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:09,930
Your Honor, I don't give
a shit about that deal.

129
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:11,230
She took advantage of my client.

130
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,231
She coerced him,

131
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:13,399
and you have the power to stop it.

132
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:16,036
I've had enough of your
language, Mr. Specter.

133
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:17,136
It wasn't coercion.

134
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:19,138
It was negotiated by a
competent attorney.

135
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,340
It's rock solid, and there's
no basis to stop it.

136
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:23,109
He's not a competent attorney.

137
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:25,178
He's cutting a deal to
plead guilty to fraud.

138
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,744
You want to cut a
different deal with me? I'm all ears.

139
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:29,205
Yeah, the only problem with that
is you can't sign a different deal,

140
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:30,772
because you already signed
your rights to that away.

141
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:33,184
God damn it, Mike, don't do this.

142
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,151
We can go to verdict.

143
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:35,352
Don't give me that.

144
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:36,654
You weren't racing over to her office

145
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:37,755
to tell her that the jury was back.

146
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,923
You were going to jump on the grenade,

147
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,224
and I beat you to it.

148
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,361
Now I told you it's done, and it's done.

149
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:47,164
Are you absolutely sure, Mr. Ross?

150
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,432
I am, Your Honor.

151
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,701
Then, Mr. Ross, you have 72 hours

152
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,704
to report to Danbury Federal Prison.

153
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:32,045
Give it to me straight.

154
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,414
What happened?

155
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,182
Mike pled guilty, and in exchange,

156
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:38,218
they can't go after you,
Harvey, Louis, or any of us.

157
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:39,586
Shit.

158
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:40,954
For someone who just found out

159
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,923
she's not going to prison,
you don't seem happy.

160
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,309
I was never worried about
going to prison, Donna.

161
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,409
What are you worried about?

162
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:49,744
Losing my firm.

163
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,281
Now that Mike pled guilty,
every case he ever touched

164
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:53,848
has "lawsuit" written all over it.

165
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:55,384
So what are we gonna do?

166
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,120
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

167
00:05:58,155 --> 00:05:59,555
We're gonna restructure this firm,

168
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,957
and we're gonna do it before
the lawsuits even start.

169
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,658
Get me Louis.

170
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:07,338
Michael.

171
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:10,307
Gloria, what are you doing here?

172
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:12,142
I came here to be with
you for the verdict,

173
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,777
but they told me you made a deal.

174
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:15,045
I did.

175
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,880
Michael, there's no
way the Lord would have

176
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:19,015
put me through two
innocent men going away.

177
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:21,318
But Mrs. Danner, I'm not innocent,

178
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:23,454
and I did what they accused me of.

179
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,809
I'm not stupid, Michael.

180
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,610
I didn't mean you went to law school.

181
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:32,347
I meant you are innocent in your heart,

182
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,316
and now you've chosen to go to a place

183
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:36,051
filled with men who aren't.

184
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,052
I don't think you understand.

185
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,286
I'm going to a white-collar prison.

186
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:40,488
There's no such thing
as a white-collar prison

187
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:43,273
once they close those doors.

188
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:46,442
You need to hear me.

189
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:48,343
Gloria, look, I know that
you are trying to help,

190
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,112
but I took responsibility
for what I did,

191
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:51,113
and I'm gonna live with it.

192
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:52,548
But right now, I need to go spend time

193
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,216
with the woman I love
and make things right,

194
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:57,219
so I'm sorry, but you have to excuse me.

195
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:05,548
Robert, I got your message.

196
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,516
I rushed right over.

197
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,517
What happened to Rachel?

198
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,518
I'll tell you what happened.

199
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,485
Mike Ross is going to jail,

200
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:10,586
my daughter is heartbroken,

201
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,774
and Harvey and Jessica are
getting off scot-free.

202
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:13,707
Wait a second.

203
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:14,741
If you lured me down here

204
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:16,110
because you wanted a punching bag,

205
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,578
I can tell you right now,
that's not gonna happen.

206
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:19,646
Well, let me tell you
what is gonna happen.

207
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,315
It's about to be open
season on every case

208
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,784
that Mike Ross ever put his
good-for-nothing name on,

209
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,087
and once that happens,
it's just a matter of time

210
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:29,090
until every one of your
attorneys tries to leave.

211
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,191
I see what this is.

212
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:31,625
You want to use me to start an avalanche

213
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,060
that will bury Harvey and Jessica.

214
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:34,028
Guess what?

215
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:35,129
I'm not gonna do it.

216
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,430
Then you're a bigger
fool than I thought,

217
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:37,931
because I'm gonna find
someone that will.

218
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:39,766
Good luck with that,
because have a noncompete.

219
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:40,734
Not anymore, you don't.

220
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,069
Bullshit. You're bluffing.

221
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:44,612
Then why don't you go and ask
your ex-associate Katrina?

222
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:45,778
Because she's the one that gave me

223
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:47,614
the way around it in the first place.

224
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,291
Harvey, I heard about Mike.

225
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:00,292
I am so sorry.

226
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:01,561
Well, you can stop being sorry

227
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:04,463
and get me the name
of that jury foreman.

228
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:05,665
Harvey, you can't get a mistrial.

229
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,666
It's too late.

230
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:07,634
Mike cut a deal.

231
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,002
I don't need legal advice, Donna.

232
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:11,070
I need the name and
address of that foreman.

233
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:12,171
I don't think that's a good idea.

234
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:13,940
It's not breaking the
law anymore, Donna.

235
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:14,941
It's just a favor.

236
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:15,975
I'm not gonna ruin his life.

237
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:18,136
I just need to ask him
a goddamn question.

238
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:20,938
Well, I'm not gonna do that until
you tell me what that question is.

239
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,341
Donna...

240
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:25,775
Mike just threw his whole life away,

241
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:27,344
and there's nothing I can do about it,

242
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,313
and the only way that I can accept it

243
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:32,882
is if I find out what that
verdict was gonna be.

244
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,851
I'll get you the name.

245
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:47,131
Robert Zane just told me

246
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,599
he can take away our noncompete.

247
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:50,567
I need you to tell me right
now how he's gonna do that.

248
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:52,236
Nice to see you too, Louis.

249
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,270
Can I offer you a prunie?

250
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:54,371
No, I don't need a damn prunie.

251
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:56,158
I need you to tell me what he's up to.

252
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,261
Louis, I'm here now,
and the reason I'm here

253
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:02,731
is that I got fired for helping you,

254
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,465
and even though you
promised to bring me back

255
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:07,135
once you were named partner, you didn't.

256
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,369
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

257
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:11,339
I wanted to bring you back,
Katrina, more than anything.

258
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:13,757
Don't give me that, Louis.

259
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:15,992
I covered for you after
Sheila dumped you.

260
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:17,794
I helped you poach VersaLife.

261
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:20,730
I even forged government
documents for you.

262
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:25,035
Okay, Katrina, if I
wanted to bring you back,

263
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,136
I couldn't protect you...

264
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:27,670
From what?

265
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:30,273
From finding out Mike Ross is a fraud?

266
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,808
Yeah, I did the math, Louis,

267
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:34,510
and you couldn't have
protected me from it,

268
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:36,313
but you could use it to get
your name on the door,

269
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:38,225
couldn't you?

270
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:41,227
Are you gonna look me in the eye
and tell me that isn't true?

271
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:45,498
It's true.

272
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,500
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

273
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:50,627
Since you were honest with
me, I'll be honest with you.

274
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:51,937
I can't help you.

275
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:08,410
Are you okay?

276
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,913
No.

277
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:18,849
Rachel...

278
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,185
I just don't understand, Mike.

279
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,854
You told me you'd wait for the verdict.

280
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,389
I know.

281
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:29,626
Rachel, listen to me, all right?

282
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:30,993
I didn't do this to hurt you.

283
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:32,695
I did it because it's who I am.

284
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:33,696
I know that.

285
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,895
Then why are you
holding it against me?

286
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:38,563
Because I can't stand the
thought of losing you.

287
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:39,530
You're not gonna lose me.

288
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,099
Yes, I am, Mike, for two years.

289
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:42,233
And it could have been seven.

290
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,735
- It could have been zero.
- They took...

291
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,603
Why couldn't you just
wait for the verdict?

292
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:47,005
Because I have to live with myself

293
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
for the rest of my life.

294
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:54,858
I made a decision, and I...

295
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:59,564
I can't go back in time and change it.

296
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:02,233
But we are here right now, all right?

297
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:06,204
We have... we have three days left.

298
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:10,941
I'm gonna have to take one
of those days for myself...

299
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,962
Because you promised me

300
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:18,298
that you would have faith in yourself.

301
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,203
And you didn't.

302
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,312
You remember me?

303
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:37,646
How could I not?

304
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:39,749
I listened to you for the
better part of two weeks.

305
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:42,218
Then I'll get right to it.

306
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:43,786
I need a favor.

307
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:45,488
You got a truck needs fixing?

308
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:47,656
I want to know what that
verdict was gonna be.

309
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:48,758
No, you don't.

310
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:49,893
Yeah, I do.

311
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,527
What difference does it make?

312
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,662
It makes all the
difference in the world.

313
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,001
Then I'll tell you,

314
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:00,836
'cause I've been dying to tell somebody,

315
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:02,471
'cause it was "12 Angry Men" in there,

316
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:04,274
and I was the one.

317
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,608
Yeah, that's right.

318
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,743
One by one, I put that jury on my back

319
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:09,345
and we did the right thing.

320
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:10,579
What's the right thing?

321
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:11,747
You think I don't know what's what?

322
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:13,316
That kid didn't go to law school.

323
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:14,350
You know it, I know it,

324
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:17,219
everybody in the goddamn room knew it.

325
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,295
It was guilty.

326
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:19,328
I didn't say that.

327
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,163
That woman didn't make her case,

328
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,899
and I'm not letting my
country's justice system

329
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:25,968
go to shit on my watch.

330
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:28,738
Say it.

331
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:30,072
Not guilty.

332
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:35,077
They told us you guys
cut some kind of deal.

333
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:38,047
Guess you should have had a
little more faith in the system.

334
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:50,502
EXCLUSIVE FROM T.U.S.U.B.T.I.T.U.L.O.

335
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,269
Mr. Specter?

336
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,205
Mr. Specter.

337
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,907
Mrs. Danner, what can I do for you?

338
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,242
I tried to talk to Michael,
but he wouldn't listen.

339
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,643
Talk to him about what?

340
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,790
About what's gonna happen
to him inside that prison.

341
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,691
Mrs. Danner, I appreciate
you coming down here,

342
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:06,292
but I can't talk about this right now.

343
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:07,527
I don't care.

344
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:10,998
You're gonna listen to
what I have to say,

345
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,968
because I saw what prison
did to my son, Mr. Specter.

346
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:19,139
Michael needs to know

347
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,843
what his first day is gonna be like,

348
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,778
who to make friends with,

349
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:26,913
what guards to stay away from,

350
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:29,975
because it's the guards
that are the worst.

351
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,912
You think I don't know all that?

352
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:34,815
Then do something to
toughen up that boy!

353
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,719
I told you, I can't talk
about this right now.

354
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:39,686
Go ahead.

355
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:40,687
Walk away.

356
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:42,823
But you owe me.

357
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:45,326
Because you may have gotten him out,

358
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:48,429
but you're also the one who
put him in that hellhole

359
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:50,364
in the first place.

360
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:58,172
Louis, where the hell have you been?

361
00:13:58,207 --> 00:13:59,940
- We have a problem.
- You think I don't know that?

362
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:01,242
I need you to bifurcate the firm

363
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:03,658
into two entities, and I
need you to do it now.

364
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:04,925
I know what you're thinking.

365
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,526
If we insulate our clients, we
can hold on to our lawyers,

366
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:07,727
but that won't help.

367
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,728
Why the hell not?

368
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,696
Because Robert Zane

369
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,965
has a way to bust our noncompete.

370
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,933
God damn it.

371
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:14,568
He finds somebody to jump ship,

372
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,970
it'll be a stampede for the exits.

373
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,171
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

374
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,805
All right, then forget
about splitting the firm

375
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,674
and work on figuring out
what the hell he's up to,

376
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,777
or there won't be a firm left to split.

377
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,749
I need to talk to you.

378
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,750
I can't, Mike, not now.

379
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,751
Harvey, I need to know if you think

380
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,020
I did the right thing taking that plea.

381
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,782
God damn it, you ask me that now?

382
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:37,049
Rachel can't get past the fact

383
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,817
that I didn't wait for
the verdict to come in.

384
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:40,686
It's tearing her up, and
that's tearing me up.

385
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:41,654
Mike...

386
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:42,755
Harvey, I know that you are pissed

387
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,489
that I made a deal before you,

388
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:47,159
but I need you to tell me
that I made the right call.

389
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:50,763
You did.

390
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:54,166
How can you be sure?

391
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,801
Because I went to see the foreman,

392
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:57,936
and he told me the verdict was guilty.

393
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,171
What?

394
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:00,906
Look, the idea of you going
to prison was killing me,

395
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,875
and I couldn't let it go unless I knew.

396
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,876
But now you can.

397
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:05,277
I still wish you would have

398
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:06,779
let me take the hit instead of you,

399
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:08,914
but yeah, I can.

400
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,319
Go home, Mike.

401
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,120
Get whatever time left
you have with Rachel.

402
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:17,791
It's gonna be easier now.

403
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:20,394
I never thought the word
"guilty" would do that.

404
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,771
Are you all right?

405
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,707
I'm fine.

406
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:36,542
Can I get you anything?

407
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:37,542
Yeah.

408
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:39,844
Clear your schedule for
the rest of the day.

409
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,581
I need you to get me everything
there is to get from Mike's trial.

410
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:43,581
Harvey, I don't understand.

411
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:44,916
You said if you talked to that foreman,

412
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:46,318
you would be able to
make peace with this.

413
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:47,352
I don't care what I said.

414
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:48,519
And he said that Mike was guilty,

415
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:49,821
and Mike accepted those consequences.

416
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:51,022
He didn't say Mike was guilty.

417
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:53,091
He said he was goddamn innocent.

418
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:57,295
Oh, my God.

419
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,596
He's going away for nothing.

420
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:01,266
No, Donna, he's not going away at all.

421
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:02,233
What do you need me to do?

422
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,201
I need you to get me

423
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:04,502
everything we have on that trial,

424
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:05,803
because I'm gonna figure out a way

425
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,572
to invalidate that goddamn deal.

426
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,807
Jessica, do you have a minute?

427
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,208
I'm really busy right now, Jack.

428
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,310
I'm afraid this can't wait.

429
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:26,285
I'm officially giving you
my letter of resignation.

430
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,019
Let me guess.

431
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,354
Robert Zane made you an offer.

432
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,157
He did,

433
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,591
and as much as I didn't want to take it,

434
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:34,558
I have to.

435
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,761
Oh, you have to?

436
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,097
You begged me for a second chance

437
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,666
and a third and a fourth,

438
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:42,967
and I gave them all to you,

439
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,770
and now he's using you to destroy us.

440
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:46,871
We're already destroyed.

441
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,339
You just don't want to accept it.

442
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,141
No, this is a setback.

443
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:55,148
I'm sorry.

444
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:00,630
Jack.

445
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:05,199
I think you're forgetting about
that folder you gave me,

446
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:07,468
the one with the little
legal indiscretion

447
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:10,739
Daniel Hardman had on you.

448
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:13,241
Let's not soft-pedal it, Jessica.

449
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:15,844
It wasn't an indiscretion.
It was a flat-out crime.

450
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:17,278
And the problem with you using it is,

451
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,613
you'll be announcing to the world

452
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:20,481
yet another crime happened
under your watch,

453
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,417
and you did nothing to stop it.

454
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:25,420
And whatever clients were
willing to stay with you before

455
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:28,924
won't be willing to anymore.

456
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,104
I think I'm gonna miss this the most.

457
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:43,939
Miss what?

458
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:47,009
Coming home to you.

459
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:49,577
Rachel, I know I should have
told you what I was gonna do

460
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:50,645
before I made that deal,

461
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,550
but I didn't know I was gonna do it,

462
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:58,520
and I had, like, three
seconds to make a decision.

463
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,487
And those three seconds

464
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:03,992
took away two whole years.

465
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:09,864
Actually, gave us back five.

466
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,700
What are you talking about?

467
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:16,771
Harvey found the jury foreman.

468
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:22,672
They were gonna find me guilty.

469
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:27,843
And we only had three days,
and I took away one of them.

470
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:30,412
Hey, it's okay.

471
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:33,883
Rachel, I don't care.

472
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:37,219
As long as we're good.

473
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:39,922
I don't want us to just be good.

474
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:44,493
I want us to be one.

475
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:31,309
I want to be your wife before you go.

476
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:35,580
I want to be your husband.

477
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:46,519
Okay, I got us some coffees and...

478
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:47,487
Donna, what the hell?

479
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:48,721
This isn't everything.

480
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:49,890
What do you mean,
this isn't everything?

481
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:50,957
I mean, she had to have filed motions

482
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:52,392
and subpoenas and discovery,

483
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:53,826
and all this shit is nothing.

484
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,195
- Harvey, these boxes are...
- What?

485
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,829
This is his class ranking
that he wasn't on.

486
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:57,830
This is his transcript.

487
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,199
This is his yearbook.

488
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:02,168
Where are the things that
we can attack procedurally?

489
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:03,236
They're over there.

490
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:04,437
Then why haven't you
gone through them?

491
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:05,605
Because that's not what I do.

492
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,051
Then what in God's name
are you doing in here?

493
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,785
I'm supporting you,
Harvey, and right now,

494
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,821
I'm gonna do that by
giving you some space.

495
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,492
If you think you can
waltz into my firm

496
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:18,526
and take my lawyers,

497
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:20,294
you must be out of your damn mind.

498
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,697
Let me guess, you're
suing me for inducement.

499
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,966
You bet your ass I am.

500
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:28,186
You induced Jack Soloff into
breaking his noncompete.

501
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,487
You don't have a noncompete
with Jack Soloff or anyone else.

502
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,356
I heard you tried that
empty threat with Louis,

503
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:33,423
but it's not gonna work with me.

504
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:34,557
If it is empty,

505
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:36,860
then so is your morals
clause and your bylaws,

506
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:38,828
which states that if a named partner

507
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,232
participates in a crime,
any partner is free to go.

508
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:46,356
And conspiracy to commit
fraud is a goddamn crime.

509
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:49,159
You can't prove we
knew about Mike Ross.

510
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:51,128
Well, let me suggest
that you ask Louis Litt

511
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:55,954
about his conversation with
Katrina Bennett this morning.

512
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,489
I got you, Jessica,

513
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,057
and if you want to come after me

514
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,995
for hiring Jack, or
anyone for hiring anyone,

515
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,363
you may not go to jail,

516
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,432
but the world is gonna
know what you did.

517
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:12,298
Why are you doing this, Robert?

518
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:15,602
I don't give a shit about
you hiring a fraud, Jessica,

519
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:18,438
but you never came to me with it
once he started dating Rachel.

520
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:21,207
How could I have known
I could have trusted you

521
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:23,376
not to come after my firm?

522
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:25,911
That picture on Robert's desk

523
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:27,713
is how you could have known, Jessica.

524
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:30,250
Now if you'll excuse us, we
have tickets for the theater.

525
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,070
Sorry about before, Donna.

526
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,038
It's okay, Harvey.

527
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,740
I understand.

528
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,542
And I've been thinking we're
going about this all wrong.

529
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,710
What do you mean?

530
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,945
I mean appealing something
based on legal minutiae

531
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,946
isn't what you do.

532
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,548
And what exactly is it that I do?

533
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,683
You get people to do
things they don't want to

534
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,884
by giving them something else.

535
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,253
Donna, I can't do that with Gibbs,

536
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,221
because what she really wants is me,

537
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,123
and Mike won't let me.

538
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,824
And what if you give
her something bigger?

539
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,992
What are you talking about?

540
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,475
I'm talking about Liberty Rail.

541
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:12,106
No.

542
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:14,231
Harvey, if we're willing
to let me be prosecuted

543
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,300
for what I did, then you can give Gibbs

544
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,685
people who committed murder
and get Mike off the hook.

545
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,218
Two for one.

546
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:23,054
Donna, I am not trading you for Mike.

547
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,055
Period.

548
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,991
Then what are we gonna do?

549
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:28,726
We're gonna give Gibbs her murderers

550
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:32,096
without giving you up at all.

551
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:38,352
Louis, tell me right now.

552
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:42,622
Did you admit to Katrina Bennett
that you knew about Mike Ross?

553
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:43,690
The morals clause.

554
00:22:43,725 --> 00:22:44,658
God damn it.

555
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:45,926
Jessica, she already knew.

556
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:48,362
Her knowing and you
flat-out confessing

557
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:49,363
aren't the same thing.

558
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:50,330
It doesn't matter.

559
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:51,331
She can't prove it.

560
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,332
Louis, don't you get it?

561
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:53,767
Katrina Bennett was your protégé.

562
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:55,269
All that underhanded shit that you do,

563
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:57,459
she learned all of it.

564
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,426
What are you saying?

565
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,094
I'm saying that she recorded you,

566
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,497
and if that tape ever
sees the light of day,

567
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:05,433
any partner who wants
can walk out that door

568
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,036
and take their clients with them.

569
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:09,671
No, they can't.

570
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:11,039
Where are you going?

571
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:12,774
To the file room.

572
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:13,808
You're right, Jessica.

573
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:15,544
Katrina was my protégé,

574
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:17,445
and she knows all my dirty laundry,

575
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,048
but I also know hers.

576
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,817
Let me take care of it.

577
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:27,119
I don't think so.

578
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,720
After the way we ended
things last time,

579
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:30,189
it's the least I can do.

580
00:23:30,224 --> 00:23:31,390
What do you want, Harvey?

581
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:32,491
I want Liberty Rail.

582
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:33,625
Well, that's never gonna happen,

583
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:35,294
and you need to let that shit go.

584
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:37,763
What I need is to trade that shit

585
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:39,198
for Mike Ross's freedom.

586
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,167
What the hell are you talking about?

587
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:42,435
You give me Liberty Rail,

588
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,403
I'll give you five of my best clients.

589
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:46,138
There's no way Jessica
Pearson allows that to happen.

590
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,139
It's not her call.

591
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,274
They're my clients.

592
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:49,341
Well, I don't care,

593
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:50,676
because I'm not breaking privilege

594
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:55,214
and risking my entire career
in exchange for five clients.

595
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,371
What's it gonna take?

596
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:03,773
You want my price?

597
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:06,108
I want to go shopping at
Pearson Specter Litt.

598
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,744
Exclusive access to hire anyone I want,

599
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,445
from paralegals to senior partners

600
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:12,281
and their clients, for the next month.

601
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:13,816
You'd be gutting the firm.

602
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,917
Do I look like I care?

603
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:16,719
There is no way Jessica accepts this,

604
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:17,720
and you know it.

605
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,555
What I know is,
people will do anything

606
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,656
if they're desperate enough.

607
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:23,957
And if you're in here doing this,

608
00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:26,493
then you're desperate to save Mike Ross.

609
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:33,434
Michael, if you're here to see Robert,

610
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:34,401
he's already gone.

611
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:35,402
I'm not here to see Robert.

612
00:24:35,438 --> 00:24:36,403
I'm here to see you.

613
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:38,737
Well, I'd rather you go.

614
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:39,936
Laura, please.

615
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:41,572
Please what, Michael?

616
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,374
Robert and I were ready to embrace

617
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:45,208
the man who was going
to marry our daughter,

618
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:48,943
and it turns out, that man is a liar.

619
00:24:48,944 --> 00:24:52,246
And now you're here to get
me to convince my husband

620
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,213
to go to your wedding?

621
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,348
It's not just my wedding.

622
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:55,648
It's also Rachel's.

623
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:57,384
And I can talk to Robert
until I'm blue in the face.

624
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,718
He will never forgive you.

625
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:00,354
He doesn't need to
forgive me, all right?

626
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:02,022
He just needs to be
there for his daughter.

627
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:03,323
- He's not gonna do that.
- Why not?

628
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,691
Because you're ruining her life.

629
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:06,960
Look, Laura, I know that
I made a horrible mistake.

630
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:08,128
I'm going away for two years,

631
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:09,396
when I could have gotten out of it

632
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:12,032
by turning in my friends.

633
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:13,833
Rachel knows that's the
kind of man that I am.

634
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:16,103
That's why she wants to spend
the rest of her life with me.

635
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:20,173
Now all... all I am asking you

636
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,704
is that you help Robert see that.

637
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:25,172
I know my husband.

638
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:28,175
What you're asking is impossible,

639
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,411
and I don't expect you
to understand that,

640
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,780
because you've never been
the father of a daughter.

641
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,383
But I'll try.

642
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:37,351
I don't understand.

643
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:38,686
Of course you don't,

644
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:40,855
because you've also never been
the mother of a daughter.

645
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:50,030
Louis.

646
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:51,614
What are you doing here?

647
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:53,310
Why'd you do it?

648
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:54,249
Do what?

649
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:55,517
Don't be coy with me, Katrina.

650
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:56,985
It's one thing to share our bylaws,

651
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:00,322
but I know you recorded me,
and I want to know why.

652
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:01,756
I did it because it put my name

653
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:03,558
on the map with Robert Zane.

654
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:07,456
If you don't destroy that recording,

655
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:09,425
it's gonna put your name
on the map somewhere else.

656
00:26:12,597 --> 00:26:14,397
This is a copy of the
document I forged for you.

657
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:16,231
Yeah, the one you
reminded me of yesterday,

658
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,267
the same one that I'm
gonna give to the SEC

659
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:19,702
if you don't back off.

660
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:20,770
You don't have to do this.

661
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:22,070
You can still come work with us.

662
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:23,639
No, I can't, and even if I wanted to,

663
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:25,341
I can't trust you anymore.

664
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,709
That's not fair.

665
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:28,344
If it wasn't me, it would've
been somebody else.

666
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,280
But it was you, Katrina.

667
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:33,416
My own protégé stabbing me in the back?

668
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,318
I was just trying to
make a name for myself.

669
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:36,752
And I just wanted my name on the wall,

670
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:37,953
but let me tell you something.

671
00:26:37,988 --> 00:26:39,655
If there's one thing
that I have learned,

672
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:42,425
it's not worth being
willing to do anything

673
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,059
to make a name for yourself.

674
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:51,701
Jessica, I need to talk to you.

675
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,636
Harvey, before you ask
whatever you're about to ask,

676
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:54,637
I'm not in the mood.

677
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:56,205
Well, that's not gonna cut it.

678
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,841
I need you to waive our
noncompetes for Evan Smith.

679
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:00,042
Is this a joke?

680
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,777
It's the only way to
keep Mike out of prison.

681
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:03,278
There is no way to
keep Mike out of prison.

682
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:04,547
Yes, there is.

683
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,582
We give Evan people who
already want to go,

684
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:09,389
and I give Anita Gibbs murderers
in exchange for Mike.

685
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,357
And I've just spent the last 24 hours

686
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:12,758
fighting to keep our noncompetes.

687
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:13,792
- Jessica.
- No.

688
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:16,295
He cut a deal to save this firm.

689
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:18,731
He cut a deal to keep
us from going to prison,

690
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:19,899
and you know it.

691
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:21,000
You know, I don't give a shit

692
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:22,001
what he thought when he made that deal.

693
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:24,570
He was gonna be found innocent.

694
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:29,141
What?

695
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:31,844
I went to see the foreman.

696
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,080
The verdict was gonna be not guilty.

697
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:40,403
Then let me see your deal with Gibbs.

698
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:42,872
I don't have it yet.

699
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:45,541
Are you crazy?

700
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:48,177
You're asking me to decimate my firm

701
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:50,146
for a deal you don't
even know she'll take?

702
00:27:50,181 --> 00:27:51,781
- I'll make her take the deal.
- You don't know that.

703
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:52,782
Yes, I do.

704
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:54,884
Jessica, we have a chance to save Mike

705
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,919
and let the people who want to go, go.

706
00:27:56,954 --> 00:27:59,121
And what if it doesn't
work and we lose everything?

707
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:01,591
Then we do.

708
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,041
Jessica, Harvey's right.

709
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,374
Mike's family.

710
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,377
Even if we lose half the firm,
if we don't try to save him,

711
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:09,979
who are we?

712
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,984
Make the deal.

713
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,627
- Da...
- Where is he?

714
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,528
He's not here.

715
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:28,529
Well, that's too bad

716
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:29,898
because I came here to talk to him,

717
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:31,532
even though he didn't have
the balls to talk to me.

718
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:32,701
He wasn't afraid to talk to you.

719
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:33,902
He went to Mom because I asked him to.

720
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:34,903
Oh, okay.

721
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:36,237
Okay, let's down to this.

722
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:39,608
You marry him, and that
man ruins your life.

723
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,009
How, Dad?

724
00:28:41,044 --> 00:28:42,677
We're gonna get through the
next two years and then...

725
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:43,878
And then what?

726
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:45,513
Because you're sure as shit
not gonna be a lawyer.

727
00:28:45,548 --> 00:28:46,514
What are you talking about?

728
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:47,616
I'm talking about you graduating,

729
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:48,917
and then you're gonna stand before

730
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:50,384
the Character and Fitness
Committee of the Bar.

731
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,419
And the last time I checked,

732
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:52,687
marrying a man that defrauded them

733
00:28:52,723 --> 00:28:53,755
isn't gonna get you in.

734
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,223
Okay, and by the time that happens,

735
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:57,359
he will have served his time,
and we will have paid his debt.

736
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,825
What the hell difference
does that make?

737
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:00,227
The difference is that's what
our justice system is all about,

738
00:29:00,262 --> 00:29:01,695
and standing behind
the man that you love

739
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,513
is the definition of
character and fitness.

740
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:05,680
Okay, you tell them that,

741
00:29:05,716 --> 00:29:07,382
and they're gonna tell you
and your felon husband

742
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:08,350
to go to hell.

743
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:09,318
That's not gonna happen.

744
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:11,119
Oh, yes it is, God damn it!

745
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:12,620
These are vindictive
and protective people,

746
00:29:12,656 --> 00:29:14,223
and he make them look like fools.

747
00:29:14,258 --> 00:29:15,690
This isn't about me
not becoming a lawyer

748
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:17,125
or him ruining my life

749
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:18,927
or any of this other bullshit
that you're in here saying.

750
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:20,963
This is because he
pulled one over on you.

751
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:22,931
He can't be trusted!

752
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:29,686
Dad, I'm sorry that
I kept this from you,

753
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:31,788
but he didn't keep it from me,

754
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:35,358
and I'm telling you I can trust him.

755
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:37,960
And how can I trust you?

756
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:45,402
Well, if you can't,

757
00:29:45,437 --> 00:29:47,937
then maybe you shouldn't
come to the wedding.

758
00:29:55,902 --> 00:30:00,271
Well, that about sums it up.

759
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:03,073
I'm proud of you, Michael.

760
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,575
It's not easy to resist the temptation

761
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:08,163
to make a deal that saves yourself.

762
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:09,363
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

763
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:13,200
I did make a deal that saves myself.

764
00:30:13,235 --> 00:30:15,469
But I didn't just come
here to make you proud.

765
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:17,171
I came to ask a favor.

766
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:18,406
Name it.

767
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,708
Rachel and I want to
get married before I go.

768
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:21,875
I know it's not supposed to happen

769
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:23,344
for another couple of months but...

770
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:25,531
You don't have that kind of time.

771
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,399
Look, I promise it's not
gonna be too much trouble.

772
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:28,867
We're not gonna invite too many people.

773
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:30,702
I'd be honored, Michael.

774
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:35,907
Thank you, Father.

775
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,546
Michael, since you're
not inviting many people,

776
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:43,048
we don't have to do it in here.

777
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,683
We could always do it
in the small chapel.

778
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,985
I appreciate that, Father,

779
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:51,056
but my mom and dad weren't
married in the small chapel.

780
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,574
Okay, you're here.

781
00:30:58,609 --> 00:30:59,775
What's so important I had to

782
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,810
reschedule an arraignment
to meet with you?

783
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:03,812
Because that arraignment
wasn't gonna lead to you

784
00:31:03,848 --> 00:31:06,081
putting corporate murderers behind bars.

785
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,482
Let me guess.

786
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:09,985
You got a hold of some
incriminating documents,

787
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:12,154
and you want me to
prosecute these people

788
00:31:12,189 --> 00:31:15,323
in exchange for keeping
Mike Ross out of jail.

789
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,959
Murder for fraud, straight up.

790
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:18,627
Not interested.

791
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:19,662
Listen to me.

792
00:31:19,697 --> 00:31:21,196
Compared to this, what Mike Ross did

793
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:23,498
barely constitutes
spitting on a sidewalk.

794
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:24,906
I know that.

795
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:25,972
Then what the hell is wrong with you?

796
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:27,707
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.

797
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:28,674
You.

798
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,842
You've been bending the rules

799
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:31,044
since the day you were born,

800
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,812
and I'm not letting you
get away with it anymore.

801
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:33,980
Are you kidding me?

802
00:31:34,016 --> 00:31:35,681
You bent rules up and
down this entire case.

803
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:37,884
Except the difference
between you and me is,

804
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,352
I'm bending them to get justice.

805
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:41,821
Putting these people away is justice.

806
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:43,456
Then give them to me anyway.

807
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,466
That's right.

808
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:46,867
You've been keeping this
case in your back pocket

809
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:48,469
waiting for a rainy day,
because that's what you do.

810
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:50,170
So maybe the next time you have a chance

811
00:31:50,206 --> 00:31:53,140
to put away murderers, you'll do it

812
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:56,644
instead of saving it up
for a chit down the road.

813
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:58,378
You hate me that much?

814
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:00,848
I don't hate you, but you did this,

815
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:02,216
and you can try to get out of it,

816
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:05,219
but what you can't do
anymore is deny you did it.

817
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,855
I'm not trying to get out of this.

818
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,824
I'd take the punishment for him.

819
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:11,325
You had plenty of chances to do that,

820
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,728
but you waited until it was too late.

821
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:16,631
Now, you want to keep
Mike out of prison?

822
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:21,235
You have to convince him
to let you take his place.

823
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:36,055
What are you doing here?

824
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:39,558
Harvey, I want to talk to you.

825
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:41,261
Great, because I want to talk to you.

826
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:43,396
- I want you to be my best man.
- What?

827
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:44,364
Rachel and I want to get married.

828
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,750
You're less than a day from prison,

829
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:49,485
and you're thinking about
dresses and flowers?

830
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,553
- Harvey...
- You know what?

831
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:52,688
I'll be your best man on one condition.

832
00:32:52,724 --> 00:32:53,656
That ship has sailed.

833
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:54,657
The hell it has.

834
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:55,624
We can still call Gibbs.

835
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,592
I am not calling Gibbs.

836
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:57,693
Get it through your head.

837
00:32:57,729 --> 00:32:58,794
This is on me.

838
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,096
No, you get it through your head.

839
00:33:00,131 --> 00:33:01,597
I am not letting you go to prison

840
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:02,899
for a crime that I committed.

841
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:04,167
Well, I'm not letting you go

842
00:33:04,202 --> 00:33:06,402
when you were gonna be found innocent.

843
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:09,538
What did you say?

844
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:10,539
That's right, I lied.

845
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:12,041
The verdict was not guilty.

846
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,609
- No, I don't believe you.
- Then call the goddamn guy.

847
00:33:13,644 --> 00:33:14,677
Why the hell would you lie to me?

848
00:33:14,712 --> 00:33:15,879
Because the truth
would have broken you.

849
00:33:15,914 --> 00:33:17,313
Oh, except now you want to break me?

850
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:19,182
Because it's the only way
you're gonna let me do this.

851
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:20,683
You think putting a
ring on Rachel's finger

852
00:33:20,718 --> 00:33:21,817
is gonna make everything go away?

853
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:22,986
You know what, Harvey?

854
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:24,921
You want to come to my
wedding, you let me know.

855
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:33,537
You want to go to prison?

856
00:33:33,572 --> 00:33:36,072
Rule number one: never
turn your back on anyone.

857
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:37,708
I know what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

858
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:39,610
I'm not trying to take
your place anymore.

859
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,845
I'm trying to get you ready
like Gloria Danner asked me to.

860
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,146
- Harvey...
- Because you're weak.

861
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:44,114
I am not weak.

862
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:46,517
- Yeah, well, hit me.
- No.

863
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:47,484
- Hit me.
- Harvey, stop it.

864
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,485
- Listen.
- No, you listen to me.

865
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:49,453
You think you're not weak?

866
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,454
You're only doing this

867
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:51,522
because you feel guilty, all right?

868
00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:52,556
Louis Litt got you in a headlock.

869
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:53,791
But I am not gonna hit
you just because...

870
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:54,825
Tess's husband kicked your ass.

871
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,892
You can't handle the fact...

872
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:56,893
Logan Sanders hooked up with Rachel.

873
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:57,928
Stop right now.

874
00:33:57,963 --> 00:33:59,897
What do you think he's gonna
do with her the second you get...?

875
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:01,966
Is that what you want?
That I hate you,

876
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,348
and that you made me do this?

877
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:05,636
Because I'm gonna lose
everything because of you!

878
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:30,182
Mike, please.

879
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:32,151
Let's call Gibbs.

880
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,890
I can't.

881
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:40,426
I can't, Harvey.

882
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:42,529
I can't.

883
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:55,138
What are you doing?

884
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:59,042
Sometimes I like to
come and just watch.

885
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:00,743
See how far you've come?

886
00:35:00,778 --> 00:35:02,445
Oh, something like that.

887
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,547
Gibbs didn't take the deal, Jessica.

888
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:06,449
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

889
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:09,152
No, Louis, you were right.

890
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:14,433
He's family, and we had to try.

891
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:16,668
And whoever's left,

892
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:19,571
we'll be stronger,

893
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:21,707
even if we're smaller.

894
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:29,247
I'm sorry, Mike.

895
00:35:29,282 --> 00:35:33,118
I shouldn't have told you the
truth about the verdict.

896
00:35:33,153 --> 00:35:37,655
I probably shouldn't have
hit you all those times.

897
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:39,290
It's okay.

898
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:42,060
Makes me feel better knowing
you have it in you.

899
00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:49,868
I got to go.

900
00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:53,371
I got to ask Rachel to marry me.

901
00:35:53,406 --> 00:35:55,941
I thought you were
already getting married.

902
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:58,610
There's something I
got to tell her first.

903
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:05,817
You come here to gloat?

904
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:07,352
Because tonight is not the night.

905
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:08,754
No, Robert.

906
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:10,756
I came here to make peace.

907
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,758
You were right.

908
00:36:12,793 --> 00:36:16,161
I should have come to you,
and I'm sorry I didn't,

909
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:21,099
and I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

910
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:25,303
But I understand Rachel is
getting married tomorrow,

911
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:29,274
and I'm telling you, if
you're not there for her,

912
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:32,277
you will regret it for
the rest of yours.

914
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:50,695
Rachel?

915
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,696
I'm in the bedroom.

916
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:54,032
Don't come in.

917
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:55,000
Why? What's wrong?

918
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:56,067
No, nothing's wrong.

919
00:36:56,103 --> 00:36:58,094
I-I have my dress on.

920
00:36:58,095 --> 00:37:01,290
Rachel, come on, please.

921
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:03,491
There are about a million
things with this wedding

922
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:06,327
that aren't going as planned,

923
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:09,064
and I'm fine with that,

924
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:13,602
but I'm not gonna jinx it
by having you see me in my dress.

925
00:37:13,603 --> 00:37:16,471
Rachel, I was wrong about the verdict.

926
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:20,095
Harvey lied to me.

927
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:22,796
They were gonna find me not guilty.

928
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,900
Rachel, please open the door.

929
00:37:26,935 --> 00:37:29,036
Why are you telling me this right now?

930
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:30,604
Because you only wanted to get married

931
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,340
after you found out I was guilty,

932
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:37,401
and I didn't want to start our
life out with another secret.

933
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:38,982
You were right.

934
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:40,349
I should have had faith in myself,

935
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,851
and I didn't.

936
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,152
If you don't want to do this now,

937
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:46,655
I understand.

938
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:51,259
We can do it when I get out.

939
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:53,195
In my mind, you are out,

940
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,564
and no one knows what's gonna happen

941
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,810
after they get married.

942
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:00,177
They just know what's gonna happen

943
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:02,713
the day that they do.

944
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:05,816
And the day we're getting
married is tomorrow.

945
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:26,248
I don't think I've ever
seen a more beautiful bride.

946
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,618
That's good, because I have never seen

947
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:30,820
a more beautiful maid of honor.

948
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,456
So I don't want to bother you,

949
00:38:33,492 --> 00:38:35,424
but I just wanted to come in
and give you a little bit

950
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,759
of an early wedding present.

951
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:38,260
Donna, you don't have to do that.

952
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:40,262
Your mom and dad are here.

953
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:45,201
Thank you.

954
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:48,137
Oh, don't thank me. Thank Jessica.

955
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:53,009
I'm gonna go
and put my necklace on

956
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:55,578
before I make my mascara run.

957
00:38:55,614 --> 00:38:56,579
Okay, I'll just be outside.

958
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:59,723
No, no, please, I would...

959
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:01,591
I'd rather you stay.

960
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:05,962
Okay.

961
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:33,796
Donna, can I talk to
Rachel for a second?

962
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:34,863
Mike, you can't.

963
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:36,098
You can't see her before the ceremony.

964
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,033
Donna, please.

965
00:39:46,777 --> 00:39:49,912
Okay, Donna, can you
just help me put...

966
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:55,732
Mike, you can't see me in my dress.

967
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:58,967
Rachel, we can't do this.

968
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:00,469
What?

969
00:40:02,906 --> 00:40:05,007
I just walked in and
I saw your parents.

970
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:07,809
They're here because they have to be,

971
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:08,844
not because they want to be.

972
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,146
Mike...

973
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:13,339
It wasn't just the look
on your father's face.

974
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,442
It's the look on your mother's.

975
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:20,245
They think I'm taking away your future.

976
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:24,850
You are my future.

977
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:26,484
Hey, hey.

978
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,586
I am not saying that I
don't want to get married.

979
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:30,122
I'm just saying that if for some reason

980
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:34,686
I was responsible for
taking away your dream...

981
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:37,622
That you'd never be able
to live with yourself.

982
00:40:37,657 --> 00:40:41,425
You go finish law school, okay?

983
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:44,562
And you pass the bar, and
you become a lawyer,

984
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:49,167
and then... in two years when I get out,

985
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:51,435
if you still want to marry me...

986
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:57,308
Oh, I will.

987
00:40:57,343 --> 00:40:59,243
Of course I will.

988
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,570
How'd you know?

989
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,039
I knew, and there's no way

990
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:27,041
I'm letting you do this alone.

991
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,116
They're all gone.

992
00:43:21,481 --> 00:43:24,382
It's not your fault, Harvey.

993
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:25,450
I made my case.

994
00:43:25,485 --> 00:43:29,087
I convinced you to hire me.

995
00:43:29,122 --> 00:43:31,990
I was the one that made the call.

996
00:43:32,025 --> 00:43:36,307
You were.

997
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:40,009
But it doesn't matter.

998
00:43:40,045 --> 00:43:44,981
'Cause even knowing how
it all turned out...

999
00:43:45,016 --> 00:43:46,950
I'd do it again.

1000
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:52,388
I guess I would too,

1001
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:53,957
'cause I never thought
in a million years

1002
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:55,124
I'd meet someone dumb enough

1003
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,393
to be willing to go to prison for me.

1004
00:43:57,893 --> 00:44:00,196
I mean, Donna always said

1005
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:01,498
you were looking for another you.

1006
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:03,032
I guess you found one.

1007
00:44:10,876 --> 00:44:12,375
I guess it's time to get busy living

1008
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,345
and get busy dying.

1009
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:20,016
Well, that's goddamn right.

1010
00:44:30,395 --> 00:44:33,363
Watch your back in there, Mike.

1011
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,766
I will.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
