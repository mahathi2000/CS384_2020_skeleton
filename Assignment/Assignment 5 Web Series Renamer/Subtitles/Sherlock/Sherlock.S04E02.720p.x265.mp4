1
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:16,696
Tell me about your morning.

2
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:21,376
Start from the beginning.

3
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:26,592
I woke up.

4
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:28,553
How did you sleep?

5
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:32,254
I didn't. I don't.

6
00:00:33,256 --> 00:00:34,816
You just said you woke up.

7
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,696
I stopped lying down.

8
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:41,096
Alone?

9
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:47,975
Of course alone.

10
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:51,815
I meant Rosie. Your daughter.

11
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:54,154
- Er, she's with friends.
- Why?

12
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:57,136
Can't always cope.

13
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:02,357
And, er, last night wasn't good.

14
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:05,815
That's understandable.

15
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,335
Is it? Why? Why is it understandable?

16
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,855
Why does everything have
to be understandable?

17
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:16,096
Why can't some things be
unacceptable and we just say that?

18
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:20,363
I only mean it's OK.

19
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:23,723
I'm letting my daughter down,
how the hell is that OK?

20
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:25,403
You just lost your wife.

21
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:27,204
And Rosie just lost her mother.

22
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:36,683
You are holding yourself to
an unreasonable standard.

23
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:39,093
No, I'm failing to.

24
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:44,643
So there is no-one
you talk to? Confide in?

25
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:46,643
No-one.

26
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:49,443
Oh, I'm picking up Rosie this afternoon,

27
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:50,883
after I've seen my therapist.

28
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:54,043
Got a new one, seeing her today.

29
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:56,043
Are you going to tell her about me?

30
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:57,084
No.

31
00:01:58,604 --> 00:01:59,963
Why not?

32
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:01,923
- Because I can't.
- Why not?

33
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:04,443
Because I can't. You know I can't.
She thinks you're dead.

34
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:07,124
John, you've got to remember,
it's important.

35
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:09,444
I am dead.

36
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:15,923
Please, for your own sake
and for Rosie's, this isn't real.

37
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:19,563
- I'm dead. John, look at me.
- Hmm.

38
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:21,163
I'm not here.

39
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:24,204
You know that, don't you?

40
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:27,204
OK, I'll see you later.

41
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,964
Is there anything you're not telling me?

42
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:36,444
No.

43
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,123
What are you looking at?

44
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:42,683
Nothing.

45
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:45,723
You keep glancing to my left.

46
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:49,003
Oh, I suppose I was just looking away.

47
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:53,563
There is a difference between
looking away and looking to.

48
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:56,683
- I tend to notice these things.
- I'm sure.

49
00:02:56,684 --> 00:03:01,003
Now, I am reminding you
of your friend, I think.

50
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:02,964
That's not necessarily a good thing.

51
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:06,324
Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?

52
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,722
I haven't seen him. No-one's seen him.

53
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,803
He's locked himself away in his flat.
God knows what he's up to.

54
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:12,603
Do you blame him?

55
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:14,683
I don't blame... I don't think about him.

56
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:17,024
Has he attempted to
make contact with you?

57
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:17,803
No.

58
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:20,163
How can you be sure? He might have tried.

59
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:22,003
No, if Sherlock Holmes
wants to get in touch,

60
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:23,883
that's not something
you can fail to notice.

61
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:48,898
Well, now, won't you introduce me?

62
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:41,004
Mr Smith, will you
say something about your property...

63
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:46,404
Hello.

64
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:52,564
Mr Smith? Whenever you are ready.

65
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:54,923
The charity fund...

66
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,483
Now, please.

67
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:58,244
Bring them through.

68
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:10,803
It's difficult, having such good friends.

69
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:14,124
Friends are people you want to share with.

70
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:18,684
Friends and family.

71
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:27,518
What's the very worst thing you
can do to your very best friends?

72
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:31,524
Something on your mind?

73
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:34,803
Yes, Ivan.

74
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:36,229
Oh, yes.

75
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:40,563
Whatever you tell us stays in this room.

76
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:41,971
I think I speak for everyone.

77
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,800
Well, what is the
worst thing you could do?

78
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,924
Tell them your darkest secret.

79
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:59,883
Because if you tell them and they
decide they'd rather not know,

80
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:02,003
you can't take it back.

81
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:04,737
You can't unsay it.

82
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,110
Once you've opened your heart,
you can't close it again.

83
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:19,604
I'm kidding!

84
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,964
Of course you can.

85
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:28,563
Well, everyone,
please roll up your right sleeves.

86
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:31,723
Roll up your right sleeves. Come on.

87
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,523
Oh, it's, er...

88
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:35,603
It's a bit of insurance.

89
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,564
I don't understand. What is that?

90
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,191
TD 12.

91
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:42,563
One of ours.

92
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:43,603
One of yours?

93
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:46,443
We make it. My company, TD 12.

94
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:49,323
Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals,

95
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,284
for minor surgical procedures.

96
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:53,828
Interferes with...

97
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,203
...with the memory.

98
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:58,244
The memory. Yes.

99
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:03,963
I want to thank you, Ivan,
for allowing me to use it.

100
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:07,443
I didn't exactly know who you
were going to be using it on.

101
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,603
You mean you didn't ask?

102
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:11,203
Is everyone ready?

103
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:14,029
- No.
- Please, roll up your sleeves.

104
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:15,548
Come on, roll up.

105
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,643
This is obscene.

106
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,722
All I'm doing, Faith, dear...

107
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:32,046
...is getting something off my chest,
without getting it on yours.

108
00:07:33,044 --> 00:07:36,402
What you're about to hear me
say may horrify you, but...

109
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:38,763
...you will forget it.

110
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:40,043
If you think about it,

111
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:45,757
civilisation has always depended
on a measure of elective ignorance.

112
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:55,563
These drip feeds will keep
the drug in your bloodstreams

113
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:57,283
at exactly the right levels.

114
00:07:57,284 --> 00:08:00,083
Nothing that is happening to
you now will stay with you

115
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:02,763
for more than a few minutes.

116
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:07,563
I'm afraid that some of the
memories you've had up to this point

117
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:09,762
might also be...

118
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:13,964
...corrupted.

119
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,763
I'm going to share
something with you now,

120
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:23,164
something personal and
of importance to me.

121
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:30,644
I have a need to confess, but you,
I think, might have a need to forget.

122
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:35,403
By the end of this, you'll be
free to go, and don't worry,

123
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:38,603
by the time you're back
in the outside world,

124
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:42,283
you will not remember
any of what you've heard.

125
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:43,683
Ignorance is bliss.

126
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:45,563
Well, what's wrong with bliss?

127
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:49,844
Some of you know each other
and some of you don't.

128
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:57,604
Please, be aware that one of you
is a high-ranking police officer.

129
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,074
One of you is a member of the judiciary.

130
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:11,129
One of you sits on the board
of a prominent broadcaster.

131
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:13,483
Two of you work for me.

132
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:17,844
And one of you, of course,
is my lovely daughter, Faith.

133
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:23,324
You are the people I need to hear me.

134
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,763
I have made millions.

135
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:30,283
For myself, for the
people round this table,

136
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:32,603
for millions of people
I've never even met.

137
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:38,044
There are charities that I support
who wouldn't exist without me.

138
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:42,643
If life is a balance sheet,
and I think it is,

139
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:45,433
why, I believe I'm in credit!

140
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:54,770
But I have a situation
that needs to be... managed.

141
00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:01,039
I have a problem and there is
only one way that I can solve it.

142
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,180
And what's that?

143
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:10,804
I'm terribly sorry.

144
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:19,367
I need to kill someone.

145
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:24,033
Who?

146
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,084
Were we in a meeting? Was there a meeting?

147
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:41,403
Need to kill someone.

148
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:42,484
Faith...

149
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,560
- My dear, dear girl.
- I can't remember.

150
00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:50,002
Can't remember who
you were going to kill.

151
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:56,990
Dear, in five minutes, you won't
even remember why you were crying.

152
00:10:58,564 --> 00:10:59,843
The others are all fine.

153
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:02,163
You know they've gone down the pub.

154
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:03,644
It's all on me!

155
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,203
Oh, Faith, don't you
think I should take that?

156
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,084
It's only going to upset you. Hmm?

157
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,844
Three years ago, my father
told me he wanted to kill someone.

158
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:26,324
One word, Mr Holmes,
and it changed my world forever.

159
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:28,935
Just one word.

160
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:30,576
What word?

161
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:33,172
A name.

162
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:34,837
What name?

163
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:39,696
I can't remember.

164
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:42,976
I can't remember who my
father wanted to kill.

165
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:48,237
- And I don't know if he ever did it.
- Well, you've changed,

166
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:50,375
you no longer top up your tan
and your roots are showing.

167
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,855
Letting yourself go?

168
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:54,895
Do you ever look in the mirror
and want to see someone else?

169
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:57,415
- No, do you own an American car?
- I'm sorry?

170
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,575
No, not American, left-hand drive,
that's what I mean.

171
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:01,256
No. Why do you ask?

172
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,056
Not sure, actually,
probably just noticed something.

173
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:15,015
Are you OK?

174
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:17,535
Oh, of course you don't own a car,
you don't need one, do you,

175
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,855
living in isolation,
no human contact, no visitors.

176
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:22,575
- OK, how do you know that?
- Well, it's all here, isn't it? Look.

177
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,335
Cost-cutting is clearly
a priority for you,

178
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:26,095
look at the size of your
kitchen, teeny tiny.

179
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:28,095
Must be a bit annoying when
you're such a keen cook.

180
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:29,695
- I don't understand...
- Hang on a minute,

181
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:31,735
I was looking out of the window,
why was I doing that?

182
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:33,655
- I don't know.
- Me neither. Must have had a reason.

183
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,239
It'll come back to me.

184
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,855
Presumably you downsized when you...
when you left your job

185
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,536
and maybe when you
ended your relationship.

186
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:44,615
- You can't know that.
- Course I can.

187
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:47,175
There wasn't anything physical
going on, was there?

188
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:49,855
For quite some time, in fact.

189
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,095
There, see? It's obvious.

190
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:53,375
You can't tell things like
that from a piece of paper.

191
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:54,935
I think I just did, didn't I?

192
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,255
I'm sure that was me.

193
00:12:56,256 --> 00:12:57,415
How?

194
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,775
Don't know. Just sort of happens really.

195
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:03,016
It's like a reflex, I can't stop it.

196
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:14,095
Coat.

197
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,575
I don't have a coat.

198
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:17,815
Yes, what I just noticed. I wonder why.

199
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:20,335
Who are you talking to?

200
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:21,576
Piss off!

201
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,135
So what do you think?

202
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,895
- Of what?
- My case.

203
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:28,335
Oh, it's way too weird for me.
Go to the police,

204
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:31,575
they're really excellent at dealing
with this complicated sort of stuff.

205
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:34,255
Tell them I sent you, that ought
to get a reaction. Night-night.

206
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:54,335
Please... I have no-one else to turn to.

207
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:56,295
Yes, well, I'm very busy at the moment,

208
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:58,063
I have to drink a cup of tea.

209
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:03,735
Is "cup of tea"...code?

210
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:04,815
It's a cup of tea.

211
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:08,416
Because you might prefer some "coffee".

212
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:12,695
You're my last hope.

213
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:14,976
Really? That's bad luck, isn't it?
Goodnight, go away.

214
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:17,735
What's bad luck?

215
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:20,975
Stop talking, it makes me
aware of your existence.

216
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,895
I've always had bad luck.
It's congenital.

217
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,015
Handbag!

218
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,495
That's not rude. Congenital.
It just means...

219
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,816
Handbag!

220
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:33,095
Stop! Wait! Your life is not your own!

221
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,575
Keep your hands off it, do you hear me?

222
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:37,295
Off it. Off it.

223
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:40,975
Sorry? What? What are you talking about?

224
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:43,055
- Your skirt.
- My skirt?

225
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,775
Look at the hem of it,
that's what I noticed.

226
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,815
Sorry, I'm still catching up with
my brain. It's terribly fast.

227
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:49,775
Those markings, you see them?

228
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:52,295
You only get marks like that by
trapping the hem of your skirt

229
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:54,295
in a car door, but they're
on the left-hand side,

230
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:56,615
so you weren't driving,
you were in the passenger seat.

231
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:57,815
I came in a taxi.

232
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:59,695
There is no taxi waiting
in the street outside,

233
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:01,815
that's what I checked
when I went to the window.

234
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:03,335
And you've got all the way to the door

235
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,935
and not made any move to phone for one.

236
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,055
And look at you.

237
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:08,015
You didn't even bring
a coat, in this rain?

238
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:10,255
Now, all that might mean nothing,

239
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:13,775
except with the angle of the
scars on your left forearm,

240
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:15,855
you know, under that sleeve
you keep pulling down.

241
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,615
You never saw them.

242
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,255
No, I didn't, so thank you
for confirming my hypothesis.

243
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:21,470
I don't really need to check

244
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:22,900
that the angle is consistent

245
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,650
- with self-harm, do I?
- No.

246
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,575
Then you can keep your scars.

247
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,295
I want to see your handbag.

248
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:30,015
Why?

249
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,695
It's too heavy.

250
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:34,375
You said I was your last hope and
now you are going out into the night

251
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,258
with no plan on how
you're getting home...

252
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:38,816
...and a gun.

253
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:47,376
- Chips.
- Chips?

254
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:49,671
You're suicidal, you're allowed chips.

255
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:51,696
Trust me, it's about the only perk.

256
00:15:57,616 --> 00:16:00,455
Sherlock? Are you going out?

257
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:03,655
I think I remember the way,
it's through there, isn't it?

258
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:05,975
But you're in no state, look at you!

259
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,855
Yeah, well, I've got
a friend with me, so...

260
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:09,495
What friend?

261
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:10,536
Bye.

262
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:13,616
Oh!

263
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:18,575
Come on.

264
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:23,138
I'm Culverton Smith, and this
election year, I'll be voting...

265
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:26,775
For God's sake!
I was talking to the Prime Minister.

266
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:31,215
I'm sorry, Mr Holmes, it's your
brother. He's left his flat.

267
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:33,935
Was it on fire?

268
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:38,896
'Even when I'm on the road,
I still like quality food.'

269
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:44,735
You see the fold in the middle?

270
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:48,295
For the first few months you kept
this hidden, folded inside a book.

271
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:50,295
It must have been a tightly packed shelf,

272
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:52,135
going by the severity of the crease.

273
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,255
So obviously you were keeping it hidden

274
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,655
from someone living in the same
house at a level of intimacy

275
00:16:56,656 --> 00:17:00,055
where privacy could not be assumed.
Conclusion, relationship.

276
00:17:00,056 --> 00:17:01,695
Not any more, though.

277
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:03,775
There's a pinprick at
the top of the paper.

278
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:06,655
For the past few months it's
been on open display on a wall.

279
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:08,775
Conclusion? Relationship is over.

280
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,575
The paper's been exposed to steam
in a variety of cooking smells,

281
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:13,496
so it must have been on
display in the kitchen.

282
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,055
A lot of different spices,
you're suicidal,

283
00:17:18,056 --> 00:17:22,295
alone and strapped for cash,
yet you're still cooking to impress.

284
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:23,975
You're keen, then.

285
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,215
The kitchen is the most
public room in any house.

286
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:29,855
And since any visitor could
be expected to ask about

287
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:32,816
a note like this, I have to
assume you don't have any.

288
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:35,416
You've isolated yourself.

289
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:37,968
Amazing.

290
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:39,033
I know.

291
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,922
I meant the chips.

292
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:49,055
Hmm.

293
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:56,216
Let's go for a walk.

294
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:07,164
- You should answer it.
- It's Mycroft.

295
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:09,016
Might be about Sherlock.

296
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,616
Of course it's about Sherlock.
Everything's about Sherlock.

297
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,215
'How did you know my kitchen was tiny?'

298
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,735
Well, look, the fading pattern
on the paper, it's not much,

299
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:18,015
but it's enough to know your
kitchen window faces east.

300
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:20,336
Now, kitchen noticeboards.

301
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:26,415
By instinct, you place them at eye level,
where there's natural light.

302
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:30,255
Now look, the sun's only
struck the bottom two thirds,

303
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:31,855
but the line is straight,

304
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:35,496
so that means we know the
paper is facing the window.

305
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:41,535
But, because the top
section is unaffected,

306
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:45,535
we know the sunlight can only be
entering the room at a steep angle.

307
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:49,055
If the sunlight was able
to penetrate the room

308
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:50,775
when the sun was lower in the sky,

309
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:54,695
then the paper would be equally
faded, top to bottom.

310
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:57,055
But no. It only makes it
when the sun is at its zenith,

311
00:18:57,056 --> 00:19:02,416
so I'm betting that you live in a
narrow street on the ground floor.

312
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:07,975
Now, if steeply angled sunlight
manages to hit eye level

313
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:10,936
on the wall opposite the window,
then what do we know about the room?

314
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:18,855
The room's small.

315
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:22,987
Oh, Big Brother is watching you!

316
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:24,052
Literally.

317
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:27,935
We can keep tabs.
You didn't have to come in.

318
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:30,495
I was talking to the Prime Minister.

319
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:32,415
Oh, I see.

320
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,335
What's he doing?

321
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:36,695
Why is he just wandering
about like a fool?

322
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:40,255
She died, Mycroft.
He's probably still in shock.

323
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:41,855
Everybody dies.

324
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:44,935
It's the one thing human beings
can be relied upon to do.

325
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:47,135
How can it still come
as a surprise to people?

326
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:49,336
You sound cross.

327
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:52,467
Am I going to be taken
away by security again?

328
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:55,547
I have, I think, apologised extensively.

329
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:57,147
You haven't made it up to me.

330
00:19:57,148 --> 00:19:58,827
And how am I supposed to do that?

331
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:00,347
- Sex.
- I'm sorry?

332
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:06,187
Sex. How did you
know I wasn't getting any?

333
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:07,267
It's all about the blood.

334
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,067
This one comes from the very first night.

335
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:10,867
You can see the pen marks over it.

336
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:13,507
I think you discovered that
pain stimulated your memory,

337
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:15,187
so you tried it again later.

338
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:18,467
I'm no expert, but I assume that
since your lover failed to notice

339
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,947
an increasing number of scars
over a period of months,

340
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:23,507
that the relationship
was no longer intimate.

341
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,107
How do you know he didn't notice?

342
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:28,227
Oh, well, cos he would have done
something about it. Would he?

343
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,467
- Wouldn't he?
- Isn't that what you people do?

344
00:20:30,468 --> 00:20:32,667
- Well, that's interesting.
- What is?

345
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:33,991
The way you think.

346
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:35,188
- Superbly?
- Sweetly.

347
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:38,547
I'm not sweet, I'm just high. This way.

348
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:41,547
- Well, we just came that way.
- I know, it's a plan.

349
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:43,707
What plan?

350
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,467
What is it? What... What now?

351
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:48,108
Sorry, um, traced his route on the map.

352
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:56,347
Is he with someone?

353
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:58,587
Not sure. We keep losing visual.

354
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:00,547
Mostly we're tracking his phone.

355
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:03,467
Don't call us, we'll call...

356
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:05,787
I'm trying to sleep, can you
stop ringing my damn phone?

357
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:08,507
'Sherlock has left his flat,
first time in a week.'

358
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:10,227
- So I'm having him tracked.
- 'Nice.'

359
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,787
It's very touching how you
can hijack the machinery

360
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:14,827
of the state to look
after your own family.

361
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:16,427
Can I go to sleep now?

362
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:18,667
Sherlock gone rogue is a
legitimate security concern.

363
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:21,587
The fact that I'm his brother
changes absolutely nothing.

364
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:24,508
It didn't the last time,
and I assure you, it won't with...

365
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:29,114
...with Sherlock.

366
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:31,787
Sorry, what?

367
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:34,188
'Please phone me if he gets
in contact, thank you.'

368
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:39,187
Do you still speak to Sherrinford?

369
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,707
I get regular updates.

370
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,947
And?

371
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:45,587
Sherrinford is secure.

372
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:47,147
Are we going to walk all night?

373
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:50,307
Possibly. It's a long word.

374
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,827
What is?

375
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,308
"Bollocks".

376
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:59,467
Culverton Smith, all this charity work,

377
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:01,707
what's in it for you?

378
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,406
We must be careful not
to burn our bridges.

379
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:09,587
Do you know why
I'm going to take your case?

380
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:11,867
Because of the one
impossible thing you said.

381
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:13,667
What impossible thing?

382
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:15,987
You said your life turned on one word.

383
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:20,107
Yes. The name of the person
my father wanted to kill.

384
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:22,267
That's the impossible thing.
Just that, right there.

385
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:23,667
What's impossible?

386
00:22:23,668 --> 00:22:26,427
Names are not one word.
They're always at least two.

387
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:30,187
Sherlock Holmes. Faith Smith.
Santa Claus. Winston Churchill.

388
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:33,787
Napoleon Bonaparte...
Actually, just Napoleon would do.

389
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:34,867
Or Elvis.

390
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:37,587
Well, I think we can rule
both of them out as targets.

391
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:39,187
OK, I got it wrong, then.

392
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:41,227
It wasn't on one word,
it can't have been.

393
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:42,987
And you remember quite distinctly

394
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:45,067
that your whole life turned on one word.

395
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:48,107
So that happened, I don't doubt it,
but how can that word be a name?

396
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:51,507
A name you instantly recognised
that tore your world apart?

397
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:54,148
- OK, well, how?
- No idea... yet.

398
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:57,508
But I don't work for free.

399
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:03,170
- You take cash?
- Not cash, no.

400
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:26,587
Taking your own life. Interesting
expression, taking it from who?

401
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:31,427
Once it's over, it's
not you who'll miss it.

402
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:38,627
Your own death is something
that happens to everybody else.

403
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:42,028
Your life is not your own.
Keep your hands off it.

404
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:48,308
You're not what I expected, you...

405
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:54,227
- What? What am I?
- Nicer.

406
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:56,947
Than who?

407
00:23:56,948 --> 00:23:58,988
Anyone.

408
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:09,268
Sorry, I...

409
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:12,908
Faith?

410
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,388
Faith?

411
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,947
'You said your
life turned on one word.

412
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:30,907
A name can't be one word.

413
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:33,387
If you were to come
round asking after him

414
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,827
'that he'd rather have anyone
but you. Anyone.

415
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:39,187
You're not what I expected.

416
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:42,307
- What? What am I?
- Nicer.

417
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:44,307
- Than who?
- Anyone.

418
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:46,627
Don't think anyone else
is going to save him,

419
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:48,147
because there isn't anyone.'

420
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:50,708
- Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.
- Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.'

421
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:56,432
I have a situation that
needs to be managed.

422
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:03,627
There's only one way that I can solve it.

423
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,868
And what's that?

424
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:14,028
I need to kill someone. Who? Who?

425
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,270
Anyone!

426
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:24,187
Of course! He doesn't want to kill
one person, he wants to kill anyone.

427
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:27,147
He's a serial killer.

428
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:28,387
Anyone.

429
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:31,027
- He could be!
- Anyone!

430
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:34,348
Why not? Why shouldn't he be?

431
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,787
Oi, you!

432
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,467
What's the matter with you?!

433
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:44,347
'Anyone!'

434
00:25:44,348 --> 00:25:47,107
Do you know where you are? Are you drunk?

435
00:25:47,108 --> 00:25:48,148
Shezzer.

436
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:50,046
What are you doing here?

437
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:52,747
What were you doing in the
middle of a bloody street?

438
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:54,187
You should be at Baker Street.

439
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,068
I am. So are you.

440
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:02,827
They found your address,
they brought you here.

441
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:07,188
You've had too much.
And that's me saying that!

442
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,668
Kill.

443
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:14,872
Kill.

444
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:23,667
- Anyone.
- Anyone.

445
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:27,523
They're always poor
and lonely and strange.

446
00:26:28,508 --> 00:26:30,707
But those are only the ones we catch.

447
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:31,797
Who do we catch?

448
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:32,862
Serial killers.

449
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:36,747
What if you were rich and...

450
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:38,707
powerful and necessary?

451
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,308
Anyone.

452
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:45,908
What if you had the compulsion
to kill and money? What then?!

453
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:37,268
Well, now, won't you introduce me?

454
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,827
Right, you there!
Stop right where you are!

455
00:27:46,828 --> 00:27:49,067
- What? Oh, John...
- Mrs Hudson...

456
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,387
Do you have any idea what
speed you were going at?

457
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,507
No, of course not! I was on the phone.

458
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:55,467
- Oh, it's for you, by the way.
- For me?

459
00:27:55,468 --> 00:27:57,507
- It's the Government.
- The what?

460
00:27:57,508 --> 00:27:59,347
- What's going on? What's wrong?
- Hello?

461
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:01,707
- Look at the state of you...
- 'My name is Mycroft Holmes.

462
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,747
I am speaking to you
from the Cabinet Office.'

463
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,507
- What's happened?
- It's Sherlock!

464
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:08,907
You've no idea what I've been through!

465
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:12,667
Argh! Right! Argh!

466
00:28:12,668 --> 00:28:14,987
Away!

467
00:28:14,988 --> 00:28:17,787
- I'm out of here! He's lost it.
- Where is it?!

468
00:28:17,788 --> 00:28:20,067
- He's totally gone!
- Aah!

469
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:23,636
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends! Once more!

470
00:28:24,668 --> 00:28:27,387
Or close the wall up
with our English dead!

471
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:30,267
Set the teeth and
stretch the nostril wide!

472
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:35,107
Hold hard the breath and build up
every spirit to his full height! On!

473
00:28:35,108 --> 00:28:36,707
On, you noblest English

474
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:39,467
whose blood is fet from
fathers of war-proof!

475
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,667
And you, good yeoman,

476
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,427
Whose limbs were made in England,

477
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:43,787
show us here

478
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:44,987
the mettle of your pasture.

479
00:28:44,988 --> 00:28:46,147
Which I doubt not

480
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:48,427
for there is none of you
here so mean and base

481
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:50,747
that hath not noble lustre in your eyes!

482
00:28:50,748 --> 00:28:53,987
I see you standing like
greyhounds in the slips,

483
00:28:53,988 --> 00:28:55,508
straining upon the start!

484
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,108
The game's afoot.

485
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,947
Oh, hello.

486
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:09,261
Can I have a cup of tea?

487
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:11,083
Did you call the police?

488
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:14,147
Of course I didn't call the police,
I'm not a civilian!

489
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:18,867
These pictures, they're that
man on the telly, aren't they?

490
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:21,067
- What pictures?
- They're everywhere.

491
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:24,181
Oh, these pictures?! Oh, you
can see them too? That's good.

492
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:35,307
Culverton Smith. This, I think,
is relevant, from this morning.

493
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:39,187
He's publicly accused Mr Smith
of being a serial killer.

494
00:29:39,188 --> 00:29:42,427
Christ! Sherlock on Twitter,
he really has lost it.

495
00:29:42,428 --> 00:29:44,827
Don't you dare make
jokes! Don't you dare!

496
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:46,067
I was terrified!

497
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:49,027
Cup of tea! Oh, for goodness' sakes!

498
00:29:49,028 --> 00:29:50,387
What's the matter with you?!

499
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,788
Are you having an earthquake?!

500
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:00,640
You need to see him, John,

501
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,052
you need to help him!

502
00:30:02,077 --> 00:30:03,307
- No.
- He needs you!

503
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:06,387
Somebody else! Not me, not now.

504
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,707
Now, you just listen to me,
for once in your stupid life!

505
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:11,587
I know Mary's dead and I
know your heart is broken,

506
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:14,496
but if Sherlock Holmes dies too,
who will you have then?

507
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,496
Because I'll tell you something,
John Watson, you will not have me!

508
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:39,815
Have you spoken to Mycroft?
Molly? Anyone?

509
00:30:39,816 --> 00:30:45,415
They don't matter, you do. Would
you just see him? Please, John.

510
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,895
Or just take a look at him as a doctor.

511
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:50,655
I know you'd change your mind if you did.

512
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:53,095
Yeah, look, OK, maybe, if I get a chance.

513
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:54,615
Do you promise?

514
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:56,527
I'll try, if I'm in the area.

515
00:30:56,552 --> 00:30:58,151
Promise me?

516
00:30:58,176 --> 00:30:59,976
- I promise.
- Thank you.

517
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:12,696
Well, on you go. Examine him.

518
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:43,375
Right then, mister!
Now, I need your handcuffs.

519
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:46,495
I happen to know there's a
pair in the salad drawer.

520
00:31:46,496 --> 00:31:48,375
I've borrowed them before.

521
00:31:48,376 --> 00:31:52,576
Oh, get over yourself! You're not
my first smackhead, Sherlock Holmes!

522
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:57,335
Woman's out of control!
I asked for a cup of tea!

523
00:31:57,336 --> 00:31:59,695
- How did you get him in the boot?
- The boys from the cafe.

524
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:00,895
They dropped me! Twice!

525
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:02,895
And do you know why
they dropped you, dear?

526
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:04,136
Because they know you.

527
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:07,495
Who's this one? Is this a new person?

528
00:32:07,496 --> 00:32:10,015
- I'm against new people.
- Excuse me for a moment.

529
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:12,015
She's my therapist.

530
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:13,975
Awesome! Do you do block bookings?

531
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:15,855
- Whose car is that?
- That's my car.

532
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:17,255
How can that be your car?!

533
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:18,695
Oh, for God's sake!

534
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:21,535
I'm the widow of a drug dealer,
I own property in central London,

535
00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:25,735
and for the last bloody time,
John, I'm not your housekeeper!

536
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,935
I'm so sorry, I answered your
phone, you were busy.

537
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:30,295
I think you'll want to take it.

538
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:31,735
Yes, hello?

539
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:33,295
Is this Dr John Watson?

540
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:34,336
Yeah, who's this?

541
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:39,295
Culverton Smith.
You've probably heard of me.

542
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,655
Um, well, yes.

543
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:43,415
Get me a fresh glass of water,
please, this one's filthy.

544
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:46,776
'I mean, I'm aware of
this morning's developments.'

545
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:50,575
Yes, I'm sure he was being hilarious.

546
00:32:50,576 --> 00:32:52,535
Sorry, did you say "all still meeting"?

547
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:54,335
'You, me and Mr Holmes.'

548
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:56,295
I've sent a car, should be outside.

549
00:32:56,296 --> 00:32:58,095
Mr Holmes gave me an address.

550
00:32:58,096 --> 00:32:59,938
Well, he couldn't have
given you this one...

551
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,816
When you're ready.

552
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:13,189
When did Sherlock give
you this address?

553
00:33:13,214 --> 00:33:15,055
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks?

554
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:17,575
'Yes, two weeks.'

555
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:20,815
How did you know where to find me?

556
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:22,415
Oh, Sherlock told me.

557
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:25,216
He's not so difficult when
you've got a gun on him.

558
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:32,215
How did you know?! How? On Monday,
I decided to get a new therapist.

559
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:33,895
Tuesday afternoon, I chose her.

560
00:33:33,896 --> 00:33:36,455
Wednesday morning, I
booked today's session.

561
00:33:36,456 --> 00:33:38,655
Now, today is Friday. So two weeks ago,

562
00:33:38,656 --> 00:33:41,015
two weeks before you
were abducted at gunpoint

563
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:42,535
and brought here against your will,

564
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:44,775
over a week before I even
thought of coming here,

565
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:47,616
you knew exactly where you'd
need to be picked up for lunch?!

566
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:51,495
Really? I correctly anticipated

567
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,855
the responses of people I know
well to scenarios I devised.

568
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:56,055
- Can't everyone do that?
- How?

569
00:33:56,056 --> 00:33:57,855
Except the boot. The boot was mean!

570
00:33:57,856 --> 00:33:59,815
Never mind how,
he's dying to tell us that.

571
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:01,135
I want to know why?

572
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:04,815
Because Mrs Hudson's
right. I'm burning up.

573
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:08,798
I'm at the bottom of a
pit and I'm still falling,

574
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:10,583
and I'm never climbing out.

575
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,815
I need you to know, John.

576
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:16,935
I need you to see that up here,
I've still got it.

577
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:19,655
So, when I tell you that
this is the most dangerous,

578
00:34:19,656 --> 00:34:23,255
the most despicable human being
that I have ever encountered,

579
00:34:23,256 --> 00:34:26,175
when I tell you that this,
this monster must be ended,

580
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,415
please remember where you are
standing, because you're standing

581
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:31,776
exactly where I said you
would be two weeks ago.

582
00:34:33,336 --> 00:34:38,775
I'm a mess, I'm in hell,
but I am not wrong, not about him.

583
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,535
So, what has all this got to do with me?

584
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,775
That creature, that rotting thing

585
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,031
is a living, breathing
coagulation of human evil.

586
00:34:47,056 --> 00:34:49,855
And if the only thing I ever do in
this world is drive him out of it,

587
00:34:49,856 --> 00:34:51,656
then my life will not have been wasted.

588
00:34:54,296 --> 00:34:56,775
Look at me!

589
00:34:56,776 --> 00:34:58,176
Can't do it, not now.

590
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:00,496
Not alone.

591
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:04,056
All right.

592
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:13,575
Yeah, well, they're real enough, I suppose.

593
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:15,535
- Why would I be faking?
- Because you're a liar!

594
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:17,375
You lie all the time,
it's like your mission!

595
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,575
I have been many things, John,
but when have I ever been a malingerer?!

596
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,495
You pretended to be dead for two years!

597
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,535
Apart from that!
Listen, before I do anything,

598
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:26,095
I need to know what state you're in.

599
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:27,575
Well, you're a doctor, examine me.

600
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,335
No, I need a second opinion.

601
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,695
Oh, John, calm down. When have
you ever managed two opinions?

602
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:34,335
You'd fall over.

603
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:35,455
I need the one person who,

604
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:37,815
unlike me, learned to see
through your bullshit long ago.

605
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:39,855
Who's that, then?
I'm sure I would have noticed.

606
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:42,575
The last person you'd think of.

607
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:44,855
I want you to be examined by Molly Hooper.

608
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:47,695
Do you hear me? I said Molly Hooper.

609
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:49,815
You're really not going to like this.

610
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,216
Like what?

611
00:35:56,176 --> 00:36:00,935
Um, hello. Is, er...
I'm sorry, Sherlock asked me to come.

612
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:03,415
- What, two weeks ago?
- Yeah, about two weeks.

613
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:05,535
If you'd like to know how
I predict the future...

614
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:07,815
- No, I don't care how!
- OK, a fully equipped ambulance,

615
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:09,855
Molly can examine me on the way,
it'll save time.

616
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,255
- Ready to go, Molly?
- Um, well...

617
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:12,615
Just tell me when to cough.

618
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:14,295
I hope you remembered my coat.

619
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:17,375
I'm sorry, I didn't know that
you were going to be here.

620
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,575
Absolutely no idea what's going on.

621
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,455
Sherlock's using again.

622
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:24,135
Oh, God! Um, are... are you sure?

623
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:27,656
No, it's Sherlock, of course
I'm not sure! Check him out.

624
00:36:31,176 --> 00:36:34,015
Is Molly the right person
to be doing medicals?

625
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:36,415
She's more used to dead people.

626
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,935
It's bound to lower your standards.

627
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:41,895
I don't know. Yeah, I don't
know anything any more.

628
00:36:41,896 --> 00:36:45,055
- Mrs Hudson, as ever, you are amazing.
- No.

629
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:48,295
You're going to have to buck up a bit,
John, you know that, don't you?

630
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:49,975
The game is on.

631
00:36:49,976 --> 00:36:51,135
I'll do my best.

632
00:36:51,136 --> 00:36:55,375
Anything you need, any time,
just ask, anything at all.

633
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:56,456
Thank you.

634
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:05,015
Er, sometimes, can I borrow your car?

635
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:07,136
No. OK.

636
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:15,055
He knew you'd get a new
therapist after I died,

637
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:17,135
because you'd need to change everything.

638
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:18,856
That's just what you're like.

639
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:24,735
Thanks.

640
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:26,135
You keep your weekends for Rosie,

641
00:37:26,136 --> 00:37:28,215
so you needed to see someone
during working hours.

642
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:29,335
Because you're an idiot,

643
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:31,895
you don't want anyone at the
surgery knowing you're in therapy,

644
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:33,695
so that restricts you
to lunchtime sessions,

645
00:37:33,696 --> 00:37:35,895
with someone reasonably close.

646
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:38,535
You found four men and one woman.

647
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:42,655
And you are done with the world
being explained to you by a man.

648
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:45,535
Well, who isn't? So all he needed to do

649
00:37:45,536 --> 00:37:47,815
was find the first available
lunchtime appointment

650
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:50,695
with a female therapist within
cycling distance of your surgery.

651
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:51,735
My God, he knows you!

652
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,255
No, he doesn't.

653
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:56,135
I'm in your head, John.
You're disagreeing with yourself.

654
00:37:56,136 --> 00:37:57,375
Are you ready, sir?

655
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,615
Yes, I am.

656
00:37:58,616 --> 00:38:02,335
He is the cleverest man in the world,
but he's not a monster.

657
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:05,085
- Yeah, he is.
- Yeah, OK, all right, he is.

658
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,920
Agh! But he's our monster.

659
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:10,136
I'm a killer.

660
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:15,376
You know I'm a killer.

661
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:20,095
But did you know I'm a s...

662
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:22,415
Cut there! What was that?

663
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:23,695
Was that a light?

664
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:27,255
Er, was that me? Was I too good?

665
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:29,136
- Huh?
- He's here.

666
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:41,815
Well, how is he?

667
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:43,015
Basically fine.

668
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:45,495
I've seen healthier people on the slab.

669
00:38:45,496 --> 00:38:47,615
Yeah, but to be fair,
you work with murder victims.

670
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,815
They tend to be quite young.

671
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:49,790
Not funny.

672
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:51,861
- A little bit funny.
- If you keep taking

673
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:54,655
what you're taking at the rate
you're taking it, you've got weeks.

674
00:38:54,656 --> 00:38:57,655
Exactly, weeks!
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

675
00:38:57,656 --> 00:38:59,815
For Christ's sake,
Sherlock, it's not a game!

676
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:01,935
I'm worried about you, Molly,
you seem very stressed.

677
00:39:01,936 --> 00:39:04,215
- I'm stressed, you're dying!
- Yeah, well, I'm ahead, then.

678
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,655
Stress can ruin every day of your life.
Dying can only ruin one.

679
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:08,415
So this is real? You've really lost it?

680
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:11,175
- You're actually out of control?
- When have I ever been that?

681
00:39:11,176 --> 00:39:13,015
- Since the day I met you.
- Oh, clever boy.

682
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:14,315
I've missed you bumbling round the place.

683
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,940
- I thought this was some kind of...
- What?

684
00:39:15,964 --> 00:39:16,695
Trick.

685
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,978
This is not a trick, it's a plan.

686
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:20,019
Mr Holmes!

687
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,719
30 feet and closing, the most
significant undetected serial killer

688
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:26,924
in British criminal history.
Help me bring him down.

689
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,415
What? What plan?

690
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,345
I'm not telling you.

691
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,480
- Why not?
- Because you won't like it.

692
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:31,544
Mr Holmes.

693
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,119
I don't do handshakes.
It'll have to be a hug.

694
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,280
I know.

695
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,060
Oh, Sherlock.

696
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,999
Oh, Sherlock, what can I say?

697
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,559
Thanks to you, we're, er...
we're everywhere!

698
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,799
Mr Holmes, how did
Culverton talk you into this?

699
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,519
Well, he's a detective.
Maybe I just confessed.

700
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:01,415
Come on.

701
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:05,335
Now, it's a... it's a new
kind of breakfast cereal.

702
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,815
Mr Holmes, could you put on the hat?

703
00:40:06,816 --> 00:40:08,535
Yeah, he doesn't really wear the hat.

704
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,695
Kids will be getting two
of their five-a-day

705
00:40:10,696 --> 00:40:12,376
before they've even left home.

706
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:16,055
Sherlock's been amazing for us.

707
00:40:16,056 --> 00:40:18,015
Breakfast has got to be cool.

708
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,335
We're beyond viral.

709
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,335
And you know what makes
it cool when you're a kid?

710
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,815
What, sorry, beyond what?

711
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:23,856
Dangerous!

712
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,615
And action!

713
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:29,656
I'm a killer. You know I'm a killer.

714
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,342
But did you know

715
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,433
I'm a cereal killer?

716
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:41,616
Mmm!

717
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:44,936
And cut there, thank you.

718
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:55,375
We should bag that up, sell it.
Make money for that on eBay.

719
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:58,947
You can make more if you want,
any time you like.

720
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:05,135
Has it occurred to you,
anywhere in your drug-addled brain,

721
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:07,575
- that you've just been played?
- Oh, yes.

722
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:08,964
For an ad campaign.

723
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:11,375
- Brilliant, isn't it?
- Brilliant?

724
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:13,146
The safest place to hide.

725
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:16,375
Plain sight.

726
00:41:16,376 --> 00:41:17,735
Mr Holmes?

727
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:21,175
Culverton wants to know if you're
OK going straight to the hospital?

728
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:22,415
Hospital?

729
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:26,735
Culverton's doing a visit.
The kids would love to meet you both.

730
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:29,175
I think he sort of promised.

731
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:30,496
Oh, OK.

732
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:34,376
If you'd just like to come this way.

733
00:41:38,616 --> 00:41:42,575
So, what are we doing here?
What's the point?

734
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:44,616
I needed a hug.

735
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:52,455
What do you think, Mr Holmes?
Cereal killer?

736
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:54,216
It's funny cos it's true!

737
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,468
See you at the hospital.

738
00:41:57,493 --> 00:41:59,613
Oh, you can have this back now.

739
00:42:03,176 --> 00:42:05,096
- Have what back?
- Thanks for the hug.

740
00:42:06,097 --> 00:42:07,736
Oh, I sent and deleted a text.

741
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:09,281
You might get a reply, but I doubt it.

742
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,895
- It's password protected.
- Oh, please!

743
00:42:14,696 --> 00:42:18,455
We're going to have endless fun,
Mr Holmes, aren't we?

744
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:21,696
Oh, no. No, not endless.

745
00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:29,855
Need another hit, do you?

746
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:31,376
I can wait until the hospital.

747
00:42:40,256 --> 00:42:41,576
Are you involved much?

748
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:43,775
Sorry?

749
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:47,335
Um, with Mr Holmes,
Sherlock, in all his cases?

750
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:48,855
Er, yeah, I'm John Watson.

751
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:50,175
OK.

752
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:51,655
Dr Watson.

753
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,095
I love his blog, don't you?

754
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:54,255
His blog?

755
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:56,295
- Why, don't you read it?
- You mean my blog.

756
00:42:56,296 --> 00:42:59,335
Say what you like about addiction,
the day is full of highlights!

757
00:42:59,336 --> 00:43:01,895
- Oh, Mr Holmes, you're feeling better?
- Psychedelic!

758
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:03,645
I was just saying, I love your blog.

759
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,015
- Great, thanks.
- It's my blog.

760
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,281
It is, he writes the blog.

761
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:07,760
- It's yours?
- Yes.

762
00:43:08,696 --> 00:43:09,975
You write Sherlock's blog?

763
00:43:09,976 --> 00:43:11,016
Yes.

764
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:15,535
It's gone downhill a bit, hasn't it?

765
00:43:15,536 --> 00:43:17,296
It's this way, then.

766
00:43:24,616 --> 00:43:27,575
- Oh, my God, I love your blog.
- You're welcome.

767
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:30,695
Right, here he comes, the internet tec.

768
00:43:30,696 --> 00:43:32,416
You all know Sherlock Holmes.

769
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:39,896
Oh, and Dr Watson, of course.

770
00:43:43,096 --> 00:43:47,535
Mr Holmes, I was wondering,
well, we all were, weren't we,

771
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:50,855
maybe you could tell us
about some of your cases?

772
00:43:50,856 --> 00:43:53,935
No. Yes. Yes. Absolutely, yes.

773
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:57,535
The main feature of interest in
the field of criminal investigation

774
00:43:57,536 --> 00:44:00,295
is not the sensational
aspects of the crime itself,

775
00:44:00,296 --> 00:44:03,295
but rather the iron chain of reasoning,

776
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:07,895
from cause to effect, that reveals,
step by step, the solution.

777
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:10,735
That's the only truly remarkable
aspect of the entire affair.

778
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:14,455
Now, I will share with you the
facts and evidence as they were

779
00:44:14,456 --> 00:44:16,735
available to me, and in this very room,

780
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:20,815
you will all attempt to solve the
case of Blessington The Poisoner.

781
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:23,015
I think you slightly gave away the ending.

782
00:44:23,016 --> 00:44:25,615
There were five main suspects.
One of them called Blessington.

783
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:27,006
But it's more about how he did it.

784
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:27,935
- Poison?
- OK.

785
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:34,015
Drearcliff House, remember that one,
John? One murder, ten suspects.

786
00:44:34,016 --> 00:44:35,291
- Ten, yeah.
- All of them

787
00:44:35,316 --> 00:44:36,335
- guilty.
- Sherlock.

788
00:44:36,336 --> 00:44:39,135
Now, what did you call that one, John?

789
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:41,295
Um, something to do
with murder at the zoo.

790
00:44:41,296 --> 00:44:43,255
Yeah, I called it Murder At The Zoo.

791
00:44:43,256 --> 00:44:45,816
Or was it the case of
The Killer Orang-utan?

792
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,976
You should be wearing the hat.
The kids would love the hat.

793
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:55,295
So, any more questions?

794
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:57,455
No. I don't think so. No?

795
00:44:57,456 --> 00:44:58,535
Mr Holmes?

796
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:00,455
Good, then I'll...

797
00:45:00,456 --> 00:45:02,296
How do you catch a serial killer?

798
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:07,695
Same way you catch any other killer.

799
00:45:07,696 --> 00:45:11,455
No. Most killers kill someone they know.

800
00:45:11,456 --> 00:45:14,495
You're looking for a murderer
in a tiny social grouping.

801
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:16,855
Um, Mr Smith, I'm just wondering,

802
00:45:16,856 --> 00:45:19,655
maybe this isn't a suitable
subject for the children.

803
00:45:19,656 --> 00:45:23,215
Nurse Cornish, how long
have you been with us now?

804
00:45:23,216 --> 00:45:24,576
Seven years.

805
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:28,496
Seven years.

806
00:45:30,256 --> 00:45:31,416
OK.

807
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:37,935
Serial killers choose
their victims at random.

808
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,256
Surely that must make it more difficult.

809
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:42,692
Some of them advertise.

810
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,099
Do they really?

811
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,019
Serial killing is an expression
of power, ego,

812
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,860
a signature in human destruction.

813
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,419
Ultimately, for full satisfaction,
it requires plain sight.

814
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,819
Additionally,
serial killers are easily profiled.

815
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,179
They tend to be social outcasts,
educationally subnormal.

816
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,139
No, no, no, no, no, no.

817
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,379
You're just talking about the ones
you know. The ones you've caught.

818
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,499
But hello, dummy,
you only catch the dumb ones.

819
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,659
Now, imagine if the Queen
wanted to kill some people,

820
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,179
what would happen then?

821
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,379
All that power, all that money,

822
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,499
sweet little government,
dancing attendants.

823
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,900
A whole country just to
keep her warm and fat.

824
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,939
Hmm. We all love the Queen, don't we?

825
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,459
And I bet she'd love you lot.

826
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,819
It's all right, everyone,
I can personally assure you

827
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,179
that Sherlock Holmes is not
about to arrest the Queen.

828
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,299
Well, of course not. Not Her Majesty.

829
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:52,419
Money, power, fame, some
things make you untouchable.

830
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,699
God save the Queen!

831
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,659
She could open a slaughterhouse

832
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,619
and we'd all probably pay the entrance fee.

833
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,660
- No-one's untouchable.
- No-one?

834
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,799
Look at you all, so gloomy.
Can't you take a joke?

835
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,779
The Queen!

836
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,499
If the Queen was a serial killer,
I'd be the first person she'd tell.

837
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,179
We have that kind of friendship.

838
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,779
A big round of applause for
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.

839
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,460
Come on. Wonderful.

840
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,780
Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.

841
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,539
Where are we going now?

842
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,379
I want to show you my favourite room.

843
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,420
No, let's go in here.

844
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,659
So you've had another one
of your little meetings?

845
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,139
Oh, it's just a monthly top-up.

846
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,339
Confession is good for the soul,
providing you can delete it.

847
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,379
What's TD 12?

848
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,139
It's a memory inhibitor.

849
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,819
Bliss.

850
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,339
Bliss?

851
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,859
Opt-in ignorance.
It makes the world go round.

852
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,739
Anyone ever opt to remember?

853
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,019
Some people take the drip out, yes.

854
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,419
Some people have the same urges.

855
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,419
Now, come on, wasting time.

856
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,140
Indeed, you have,
I estimate, 20 minutes left.

857
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:13,508
Sorry?

858
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:14,730
I sent a text from
your phone, remember?

859
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,299
It was read almost immediately.

860
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,659
Factoring in a degree of
shock and emotional decision,

861
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,139
and a journey time based
on the associated address,

862
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,579
I'd say that your life, as you know it,
has 20 minutes left to run.

863
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,019
Well, no, 17 to be precise,

864
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,499
but I rounded up for dramatic effect.

865
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,859
So, please do show
us your favourite room.

866
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,859
It'll give you a chance to say goodbye.

867
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,220
Come along.

868
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:47,340
The game is on. Do you still miss me?

869
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,579
Speaking of serial killers,
you know who's my favourite?

870
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,260
Other than yourself?

871
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,459
HH Holmes. Relative of yours?

872
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,021
Not as far as I know.

873
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,900
You should check. What an idiot.

874
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,100
Everyone out.

875
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,940
Mr Smith,
we're actually in the middle of something.

876
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,380
Saheed, isn't it?

877
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,379
Saheed, yes.

878
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,539
How long have you been working here now?

879
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,364
- Four years.
- Four years.

880
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:28,348
Well, that's a long time, isn't it?

881
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,385
Four years!

882
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:34,741
OK, everyone.

883
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,099
Five minutes?

884
00:49:38,124 --> 00:49:39,444
Come back in ten.

885
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:49,379
Saheed...

886
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,900
this time, knock.

887
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:57,659
How can you do that?

888
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,339
I mean, how are you even allowed in here?

889
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,060
Oh, I can go anywhere I like.

890
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,379
Anywhere at all.

891
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,739
They gave you keys?

892
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,659
They presented them to me.
There was a ceremony.

893
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,819
You can watch that on YouTube.
Home Secretary was there.

894
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,379
So, your favourite room, the mortuary?

895
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,739
What do you think?

896
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,780
Tough crowd.

897
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,899
Oh, I don't know.

898
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,939
I've always found them quite pliable.

899
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,660
- Don't do that!
- She's fine. She's dead.

900
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,179
HH Holmes loved the dead.

901
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,699
He mass-produced them.

902
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,099
Serial killer,
active during the Chicago Fair.

903
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,299
Do you know what he did?

904
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,379
He built a hotel,
a special hotel just to kill people.

905
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:48,139
You know, with a hanging room,
gas chamber, specially adapted furnace.

906
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,059
You know, like Sweeney Todd...

907
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,620
"Without the pies!"

908
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,460
Stupid. So stupid.

909
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,659
Why stupid?

910
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,779
Well, all that effort.

911
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,739
You don't build a beach if
you want to hide a pebble.

912
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,139
You just find a beach.

913
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,899
And if you want to hide a murder,

914
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,860
if you want to hide lots and
lots of murders, just find a...

915
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,500
...hospital.

916
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,299
Can we be clear? Are you confessing?

917
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,059
To what?

918
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,580
The way you're talking...

919
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,819
Oh, sorry, yes.

920
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,499
You mean, am I a serial killer?

921
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,739
Or am I just trying to mess
with your funny little head?

922
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,379
Well, it's true.

923
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,059
I do like to mess with people,
and, yes, I am a bit creepy.

924
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,379
But that's just my USP.

925
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,619
I use it to sell breakfast cereal.

926
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,939
But am I what he says I am?

927
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,699
Is that what you're asking?

928
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,299
Yes.

929
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:58,099
Hmm. Well, let me ask you this...
are you really a doctor?

930
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,419
Yeah, of course I am.

931
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,819
Oh, no, a medical doctor?

932
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,899
You know, not just feet or
media studies or something?

933
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,940
I'm a doctor.

934
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,419
Are you serious?

935
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,940
No, really, are you?

936
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,859
Are you...

937
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,860
are you actually serious?

938
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,539
I've played along with this joke,
it's not funny any more.

939
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,739
Look at him!

940
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,699
Go ahead, look at him, Dr Watson!

941
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,339
Oh, no, I'll lay it out for you.

942
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,259
There are two possible explanations
for what's going on here.

943
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,699
Either I'm a serial killer,

944
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,739
or Sherlock Holmes is
off his tits on drugs!

945
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,579
Hmm? Delusional paranoia
about a public personality.

946
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,219
That's not so special, it's not even new.

947
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,219
I think you need to tell
your faithful little friend

948
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,939
how you're wasting his time,

949
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,260
because you're too high to
know what's real any more.

950
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,500
I apologise.

951
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,580
I... I've miscalculated.

952
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,659
I forgot to factor in the traffic.

953
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,059
19 minutes.

954
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,859
Ah, the footsteps you're about to
hear will be very familiar to you,

955
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,859
not least because there'll be
three impacts rather than two.

956
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,459
The third, of course,
will be the end of a walking cane.

957
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,459
Your daughter Faith's walking cane.

958
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,419
And why would she be here?

959
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,099
You invited her. You sent her a text.

960
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,380
Or technically, I sent her a text,
but she's not to know.

961
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,699
Now, let's see if I can recall.

962
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:49,459
"Faith, I can stand it no longer,
I've confessed to my crimes.

963
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,739
"Please forgive me."

964
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,059
Why would that have any effect?
You don't know her.

965
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,140
Oh, but I do. I spent
a whole evening with her.

966
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,619
We had chips. I think she liked me.

967
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,483
You don't know Faith. You simply do not.

968
00:54:06,508 --> 00:54:08,347
I know you care about her deeply.

969
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:12,726
I know you invited her to one
of your special board meetings.

970
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:14,831
You care what she thinks.

971
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,300
You maintain an impressive facade.

972
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,819
I think it's about to break.

973
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,979
Did you know?

974
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,499
She came to Baker Street.

975
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,819
No, she didn't.

976
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,979
Of course I didn't.

977
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:34,619
She came to see me,
because she was scared of her daddy.

978
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:39,899
Never happened. Is this another
one of your drug-fuelled fantasies?

979
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,339
- You didn't see him take the scalpel?
- Nobody saw him.

980
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,099
So you didn't know what
was about to happen?

981
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,579
Of course I didn't know.

982
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,739
Well, let's see, shall we?

983
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,019
Faith, stop loitering at
the door and come in.

984
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,368
This is your father's favourite room!

985
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,499
Come and meet his best friends.

986
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,699
Dad? What's happening?

987
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,420
What was that text?
Are you having one of your jokes?

988
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,060
Who are you?

989
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,020
Who the hell are you?!

990
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,019
It's Sherlock Holmes,
surely you recognise him?

991
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,817
Oh, my God! Sherlock Holmes!

992
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,659
I love your blog.

993
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,219
You're not her, you're not the
woman who came to Baker Street.

994
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,419
Um, well, no. Never been there.

995
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,579
Well, there must have been some build-up,

996
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,219
he didn't just suddenly do it.

997
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,219
Look, I didn't know he
had the bloody scalpel!

998
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,819
Sorry, I'm not sure I
completely understand.

999
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,339
Understand what?

1000
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,459
Well, I thought you two were...
were old friends?

1001
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,579
No. We've never met.

1002
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,819
Oh, dear. Oh!

1003
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,339
Have we?

1004
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,100
Sherlock?

1005
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,179
So, who came to my flat?

1006
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,739
Well, it wasn't me.

1007
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,179
No!

1008
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,419
You look different.

1009
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,939
I wasn't there.

1010
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,219
'Who came to my flat?'

1011
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,339
I'm sorry, Mr Holmes,

1012
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:23,139
but I don't think I've ever
been anywhere near your flat.

1013
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,499
Oh, dear. Oh, no!

1014
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,899
Who are you talking to?

1015
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,779
What friend?

1016
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,019
Anyone.

1017
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,859
Oh, no. Oh, no!

1018
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,979
'Faith?

1019
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,700
Oh, God!'

1020
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,539
Oh, no. Oh, no!

1021
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,940
Sherlock?

1022
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,099
Sherlock, are you all right?
Sherlock, are you OK?

1023
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,219
- Watch him, he's got a knife.
- I've got a what?

1024
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,259
You've got a scalpel, you picked it
up from that table! I saw you take it.

1025
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,819
I certainly did not!

1026
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,259
Look behind his back!

1027
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,419
No...

1028
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,019
I saw you take it! I saw you!

1029
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,939
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1030
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,939
Sherlock, do you want to put that down?

1031
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,140
Oh, my God!

1032
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,459
Stop laughing at me.

1033
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,539
- I'm not laughing.
- He's not laughing, Sherlock.

1034
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,340
- Stop laughing at me!
- Sherlock!

1035
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:29,779
Oh, Christ! I keep wondering if
we should have seen it coming.

1036
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,939
Not long ago he shot Charles
Magnussen in the face,

1037
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,099
we did see it coming.

1038
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,699
We always saw it coming. But it was fun.

1039
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,339
Come in.

1040
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,100
Sir, you probably want to see this.

1041
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,459
'Harold Chorley
reporting earlier today.

1042
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,859
'Mr Smith stated he had no
interest in bringing charges.'

1043
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,699
'I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes,
I'm a big fan.

1044
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,299
'I don't really know what happened
today. To be honest,

1045
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,699
'I don't think I'd be standing here
now if it wasn't for Dr Watson.'

1046
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,779
Stop laughing at me!

1047
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,219
Sherlock!

1048
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,659
Stop it! Stop it now!

1049
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,539
'Is it true he's
being treated in your hospital?'

1050
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,339
'It's not actually my hospital.'

1051
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,219
Well, it is a little bit my hospital.

1052
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:20,579
But I can promise you this,
he is going to get the best of care.

1053
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,219
I might even move him to my favourite room.

1054
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,260
'Culverton Smith,
earlier today. In Nottingham...'

1055
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,619
He's right, you know,
you probably saved his life.

1056
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,299
What are you doing?! Wake up!

1057
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,940
I really hit him, Greg. Hit him hard.

1058
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:46,900
Is this a game? Is it just a bloody game?

1059
00:58:54,700 --> 00:59:00,219
Please! Please, please, please, no
violence. Thank you, Dr Watson.

1060
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:04,619
But I don't think he's a danger any more.

1061
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,979
Leave him be.

1062
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,980
No, it's OK.

1063
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,780
Let him do what he wants. He's entitled.

1064
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,180
I killed his wife.

1065
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,180
Yes, you did.

1066
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,860
Oh, hi.

1067
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,459
Just in to say hello?

1068
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,019
No. I'm just in to say goodbye.

1069
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,099
I'm sure he'll pull through.

1070
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,299
And yeah, he's made a terrible mess
of himself, but he's awfully strong.

1071
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,100
So, must look on the bright side.

1072
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,860
Hm.

1073
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,900
Well...

1074
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,379
Parting gift. Ah, that's nice.

1075
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,779
A walking stick.

1076
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,220
Yeah, it was mine, from a long time ago.

1077
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,619
Hello? Ward 73.

1078
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,579
Oh, er, Dr Watson?

1079
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:42,739
Hm?

1080
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,180
It's for you.

1081
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,300
Oh.

1082
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,619
Hello, Mycroft.

1083
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,940
'There's a car downstairs.'

1084
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:59,019
You know, he should
definitely have worn the hat.

1085
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,499
Still thinking about Sherlock?

1086
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,819
No. You are.

1087
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,899
You've got your disapproving face on.

1088
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,779
Well, seeing as I'm inside your head,

1089
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,500
I think we can call that self-loathing.

1090
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,818
Where is she?
Where's Mrs Hudson?

1091
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:00,979
She'll be up in a moment.

1092
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,259
What are you doing?

1093
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,019
Have you noticed the kitchen?
It's practically a meth lab.

1094
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,979
I'm trying to establish exactly
what drove Sherlock off the rails.

1095
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,700
Any ideas? Are these spooks?

1096
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,379
Are you using spooks now
to look after your family?

1097
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,219
- Hang on, are they tidying?
- Sherlock is a security concern.

1098
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,179
The fact that I'm his
brother changes nothing.

1099
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,499
- Yeah, you've said that before.
- Ask him.

1100
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,379
Why fixate on Culverton Smith?

1101
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,579
He's had his obsessions before,
of course, but

1102
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,379
this goes a bit further than setting
a man-trap for Father Christmas.

1103
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,859
Do it. Ask him.

1104
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,219
Spending all night talking to
a woman who wasn't even there.

1105
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,379
Oh, shut up, you!

1106
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,099
Mycroft, last time, when we were on the phone...
- No, no, no, no, stop.

1107
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,499
I detest conversation in the past tense.

1108
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,059
You said the fact that you were
his brother made no difference.

1109
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,539
It doesn't.

1110
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,059
You said it didn't the last time,
and it wouldn't with Sherlock.

1111
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:48,179
So who was it the last time?
Who were you talking about?

1112
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,339
Attaboy!

1113
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,859
Nobody. I... misspoke.

1114
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,579
He's lying. You're lying.

1115
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,740
I assure you, I'm not. He really is lying.

1116
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,020
Sherlock's not your only brother.

1117
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,459
There's another one, isn't there?

1118
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,419
- No...
- Jesus! A secret brother.

1119
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:09,819
What is he, locked up in a tower,
or something?

1120
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,219
Mycroft Holmes!

1121
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,099
What are all these dreadful
people doing in my house?!

1122
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,179
Mrs Hudson, I apologise
for the interruption.

1123
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,259
As you know, my brother has embarked on

1124
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:21,499
a programme of self-destruction
remarkable even by his standards,

1125
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,059
and I am endeavouring to
find out what triggered it.

1126
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,459
- And that's what you're all looking for?
- Quite so.

1127
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,579
What's on his mind? So to speak.

1128
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,139
And you've had all this time?

1129
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,739
Time being something of which we
don't have an infinite supply,

1130
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,979
so if we could be about our business.

1131
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,699
You... you're so funny, you are!

1132
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,339
Mrs Hudson?

1133
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:45,379
He thinks you're clever, poor old
Sherlock. Always going on about you.

1134
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,899
I mean, he knows you're an idiot,

1135
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,059
but that's OK, cos you're a lovely doctor.

1136
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:52,219
But he has no idea what an idiot you are!

1137
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,379
Is this merely
stream-of-consciousness abuse,

1138
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:56,139
or are you attempting to make a point?

1139
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,059
You want to know what's bothering Sherlock?

1140
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,859
Easiest thing in the world,
anyone can do it.

1141
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,819
I know his thought processes
better than any other human being,

1142
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,299
so, please, try to understand.

1143
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,219
He's not about thinking. Not Sherlock.

1144
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,979
- Of course he is.
- No, no.

1145
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,059
He's more emotional, isn't he?

1146
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,499
Unsolved case, shoot
the wall! Boom, boom!

1147
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,979
Unmade breakfast, karate the fridge.

1148
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,219
Unanswered question...

1149
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:23,459
Well, what does he do with anything
he can't answer, John? Every time?

1150
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,019
He stabs it.

1151
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:29,979
Anything he can't find the
answer for, bang! It's up there.

1152
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,939
I keep telling him,
if he was any good as a detective,

1153
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,740
I wouldn't need a new mantel!

1154
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:43,019
'If you're watching this,
I'm... probably dead.'

1155
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,899
OK, no. Stop that now, please.

1156
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,019
Everybody out, now!

1157
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,899
All of you!

1158
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:54,099
This is my house, this is my friend,
and that's his departed wife.

1159
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,219
Anyone who stays here a minute
longer is admitting to me personally

1160
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:00,100
they do not have a single
spark of human decency.

1161
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:13,380
Get out of my house, you reptile!

1162
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,059
You've been ages waking up.

1163
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,300
I watched you.

1164
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:30,380
It was quite lovely, in its way.

1165
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:34,299
Take it easy, it's OK.

1166
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,060
Don't want to rush this.

1167
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,099
You're Sherlock Holmes.

1168
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,659
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

1169
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,419
Might be the hardest case of your career.

1170
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:49,139
When I'm... gone,

1171
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,139
if I'm gone,

1172
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,140
I need you to do something for me.

1173
01:05:54,927 --> 01:05:56,407
Save John Watson.

1174
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,779
Save him, Sherlock.'

1175
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,219
John, if you want to watch this later...

1176
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,019
'Save him.

1177
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,139
Don't think anyone else
is going to save him,

1178
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,579
because there isn't anyone.

1179
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,379
It's up to you.

1180
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,739
Save him.

1181
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:13,379
But I do think you're going to
need a little bit of help with that,

1182
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,299
because you're not
exactly good with people,

1183
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,179
so here's a few things you need
to know about the man we both love.

1184
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,220
And more importantly, what you're
going to need to do to save him.'

1185
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,900
How did you... get in?

1186
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,060
Policeman outside, you mean?

1187
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,780
Come on, can't you guess?

1188
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,792
Secret door.

1189
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,180
I built this whole wing.

1190
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,939
I kept firing the architects and builders,

1191
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,979
so no-one knew quite how
it all fitted together.

1192
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:54,300
I can slip in and out,
anywhere I like, you know.

1193
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,179
When I get the urge.

1194
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,539
HH Holmes.

1195
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,560
Murder Castle. But done right.

1196
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,779
I have a question for you.
Why are you here?

1197
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,300
It's like you walked into my den
and laid down in front of me.

1198
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,620
Why?

1199
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,859
You know why I'm here.

1200
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,820
I'd like to hear you say it.

1201
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,780
Say it for me, please.

1202
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,432
I want you to kill me.

1203
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,660
John?

1204
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,340
My car.

1205
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,979
If you increased the
dosage four or five times,

1206
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:46,819
toxic shock should shut me
down within about an hour.

1207
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,299
Then I restore the settings.

1208
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,940
Everyone assumes it was a fault, or...

1209
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,100
- ...you just gave up the ghost.
- Yes.

1210
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,580
You're rather good at this.

1211
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,980
Before we start, tell me how you feel.

1212
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,060
I... I feel scared.

1213
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,659
Be more specific.

1214
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,700
You only get to do this the once.

1215
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,220
I'm scared of dying.

1216
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,100
You wanted this, though.

1217
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,539
I have reasons.

1218
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:28,219
But you don't actually want to die.

1219
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,859
No.

1220
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:31,020
Good.

1221
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,383
Say that for me.

1222
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,300
- Say it.
- I don't want to die.

1223
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,539
And again.

1224
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,100
I don't... want to die.

1225
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,531
Once more, for luck.

1226
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,260
I don't want to die.

1227
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,219
I don't.

1228
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,700
I don't want to die.

1229
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,700
Lovely.

1230
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,020
Here it comes.

1231
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,939
Please, I don't think he's safe.

1232
01:09:13,964 --> 01:09:15,599
'No, he's fine,
I've got a man on the door.'

1233
01:09:15,623 --> 01:09:18,419
- 'What do you think's happened?'
- I don't know, something!

1234
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,379
- Mary left a message.
- What message?

1235
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:24,219
'John Watson never accepts help.

1236
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,419
Not from anyone, not ever.

1237
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,939
But here's the thing,
he never refuses it.

1238
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,300
So, here's what you are going to do.'

1239
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:35,499
So, tell me, why are we doing this?

1240
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,155
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1241
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,099
I wanted to hear your confession,

1242
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,579
needed to know I was right.

1243
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,899
But why do you need to die?

1244
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:48,380
The mortuary, your favourite room.

1245
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,619
You talk to the dead.

1246
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,140
You make your confession to them.

1247
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,700
Sorry, sir, what? What do you mean?

1248
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,939
I think the door's jammed.

1249
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,259
Oh, has that door locked itself again?

1250
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:07,739
Yeah, it's always doing that.

1251
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,979
'You can't save John,
because he won't let you.

1252
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,300
He won't allow himself to be saved.

1253
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:19,219
The only way to save John
is to make him save you.'

1254
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,460
Why do you do it?

1255
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,740
Why do I kill?

1256
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:28,397
It's not about hatred, or... or revenge.

1257
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:31,239
I'm not a dark person.

1258
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,899
Killing human beings...

1259
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:44,780
...it just makes me...
oh, incredibly happy.

1260
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,939
You know, in films, when you see
dead people, pretending to be dead,

1261
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,860
and it's just living people lying down?

1262
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,539
Well, that's not what
dead people look like.

1263
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:07,580
Dead people... look like things.

1264
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:12,419
I like to make people into things,

1265
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,819
then you can own them.

1266
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:17,700
You know what?
I'm getting a little impatient.

1267
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,100
Take a big breath if you want.

1268
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,100
'Go to hell, Sherlock.

1269
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:44,379
Go right into hell and make
it look like you mean it.'

1270
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:47,459
Murder is a very difficult
addiction to manage.

1271
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,099
People don't realise how
much work goes into it.

1272
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,659
You have to be careful.

1273
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:55,699
But if you're rich or
famous and... loved,

1274
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,380
it's amazing what people
are prepared to ignore.

1275
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:03,859
But there's always someone
desperate about to go missing,

1276
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:07,419
and no-one wants to suspect murder

1277
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,459
if it's easier to suspect something else.

1278
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:14,579
I just have to ration myself,
choose the right heart to stop.

1279
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:20,019
'Go and pick a fight with a bad guy,
put yourself in harm's way.'

1280
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,939
Please! Maintain eye contact.

1281
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,899
Maintain eye contact.

1282
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,059
Maintain eye contact!

1283
01:12:27,084 --> 01:12:30,755
I like to watch it happen.

1284
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,300
'If he thinks you need him, I swear...'

1285
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:43,100
And off we... pop.

1286
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,219
'...he will be there.'

1287
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,219
Mr Holmes, are you OK?

1288
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,939
What were you doing to him?!
What were you doing?!

1289
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:56,979
- He's in distress, I'm helping him.
- Restrain him now. Do it.

1290
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,539
I was trying to help him!

1291
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:02,019
- Sherlock, what was he doing to you?
- Suffocating me, overdosing me.

1292
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,144
- On what?
- Saline.

1293
01:13:03,169 --> 01:13:04,619
- Saline?
- Yes, saline.

1294
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,539
What do you mean, saline?

1295
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:10,099
Well, obviously, I got Nurse
Cornish to switch the bags.

1296
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,939
She's a big fan, you know? Loves my blog.

1297
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:15,339
- You're OK?
- No, no, of course I'm not OK.

1298
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,019
Malnourished, double kidney failure,

1299
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,019
and frankly,
I've been off my tits for weeks.

1300
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,739
What kind of a doctor are you?

1301
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,539
I got my confession, though, didn't I?

1302
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,379
Well, I don't recall making any confession.

1303
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:30,179
- What would I be confessing to?
- You can listen to it later.

1304
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:32,459
Well, there is no confession to listen to.

1305
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,739
Oh, Mr Holmes, I don't
know if this is relevant, but...

1306
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:39,859
we found three potential recording
devices in the pockets of your coat.

1307
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:41,739
All your possessions were searched.

1308
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:42,940
Sorry!

1309
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:48,899
Must be something comforting
about the number three,

1310
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,700
people always give up after three.

1311
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,300
What? What is it? What?

1312
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:04,899
- You cock!
- Yeah.

1313
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,580
Utter, utter cock. Heard
you the first time.

1314
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,540
- So, how does it open?
- Screw the top.

1315
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,659
- Two weeks ago?
- Three.

1316
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:27,420
- I'm that predictable?
- No.

1317
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,900
I'm just a cock.

1318
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,179
It's funny.

1319
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:47,699
I never realised confessing
would be so enjoyable.

1320
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,620
I should have done it sooner.

1321
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,259
We'll carry on tomorrow.

1322
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:56,579
Well, we could carry on now, I'm not tired.

1323
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,979
There's loads more.

1324
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,699
Tomorrow.

1325
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:03,179
You know, I am going to be so famous now.

1326
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,979
You're already famous.

1327
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:07,180
Yeah, but with this...

1328
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,460
...I can break America.

1329
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,459
I had, of course,
several other backup plans.

1330
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:20,219
Trouble is, I couldn't
remember what they were.

1331
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,019
And, of course, I hadn't really anticipated

1332
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,699
that I'd hallucinated meeting his daughter.

1333
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,419
Basically, he trashed himself
on drugs so that you'd help him,

1334
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,619
so that you'd have something to do,
something doctory.

1335
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,899
You get that now?

1336
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,099
Still a bit troubled by the daughter.

1337
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,819
It did seem very real.

1338
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:38,739
She gave me information I
couldn't have acquired elsewhere.

1339
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:40,819
But she wasn't ever here?

1340
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,059
Interesting, isn't it?

1341
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,379
I have theorised before that
if one could attenuate to

1342
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,699
every available data stream
in the world simultaneously,

1343
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,940
it would be possible to anticipate
and deduce almost anything.

1344
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,859
Hmm.

1345
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,939
So, you dreamed up a magic woman
who told you things you didn't know?

1346
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:59,739
Well, sounds about right to me.
Possibly, I'm biased.

1347
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:03,580
Perhaps the drugs opened
certain doors in my mind.

1348
01:16:06,255 --> 01:16:08,175
- I'm intrigued.
- I know you are.

1349
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:12,219
Which is why we're all taking it in
turns to keep you off the sweeties.

1350
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,940
I thought we were just hanging out.

1351
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,659
Molly will be here in 20 minutes.

1352
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,100
Oh, I do think I can last 20
minutes without supervision.

1353
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,259
Well, if you're sure.

1354
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,140
Christ, John, stay, talk!

1355
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:32,339
Uh, sorry, it's just, um, you know, Rosie.

1356
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,899
Yes, of course, Rosie.

1357
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,019
Go and solve a crime together,
make him wear the hat.

1358
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,659
- You'll be OK for 20 minutes?
- Yes, yes.

1359
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:42,299
- Sorry, I... I wasn't thinking of Rosie.
- No problem.

1360
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,940
I should, er, come and see her soon.

1361
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:49,179
Yes. Actually, he should wear the
hat as a special tribute to me.

1362
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,659
I'm dead, I would really appreciate it.

1363
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:54,819
Oh, by the way, the recordings
will probably be inadmissible.

1364
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,859
- Sorry, what?
- Well, technically, it's entrapment,

1365
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,739
so it might get thrown out as evidence.

1366
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:01,699
Not that that matters.
Apparently he can't stop confessing.

1367
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,340
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1368
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,339
Are you OK?

1369
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,019
What, am I...? No, no, I'm not OK.

1370
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,819
I'm never going to be OK.

1371
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:18,059
And we'll just have to accept that.

1372
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,339
It is what it is,

1373
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,939
and what it is is... shit.

1374
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:22,980
John, do better.

1375
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,899
You didn't kill Mary.
Mary died saving your life.

1376
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,819
It was her choice, no-one made her do it.

1377
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,459
No-one could ever make her do anything.

1378
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,709
The point is, you did not kill her.

1379
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:40,780
In saving my life,
she conferred a value on it.

1380
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,420
It is a currency I do
not know how to spend.

1381
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,380
It is what it is.

1382
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,419
I'm tomorrow, six till ten.
I'll see you then.

1383
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:01,059
- Looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

1384
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,659
That noise, that's a text alert noise?

1385
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:07,820
What was that?

1386
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,059
Hmm? What was what?

1387
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,859
That's the text alert of Irene Adler.

1388
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,419
She's the scary mad one, right?

1389
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:17,019
- That noise?
- What noise?

1390
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,299
But she's dead.

1391
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,099
Ooh, I bet she isn't dead!

1392
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,019
I bet he saved her.

1393
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,779
Oh, my God!

1394
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:27,499
Oh, the posh boy loves the dominatrix.

1395
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,179
He's never knowingly under-cliched, is he?

1396
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,019
John?

1397
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:34,779
- I'm going to make a deduction.
- Oh, OK, that's good.

1398
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,259
And if my deduction is right,

1399
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:38,539
you're going to be
honest and tell me, OK?

1400
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:39,299
OK.

1401
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:42,099
Though I should mention that it is
possible for any given text alert

1402
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,060
- to become randomly attached to...
- Happy birthday.

1403
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:51,299
Thank you, John, that's...
very kind of you.

1404
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,299
Never knew when your birthday was.

1405
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,179
Well, now you do.

1406
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,593
Seriously, we're not going to

1407
01:18:56,618 --> 01:18:58,299
- talk about this?
- Talk about what?

1408
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,379
I mean, how does it work?
How does what work?

1409
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,739
You and The Woman.

1410
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,699
Do you go to a discreet
Harvester sometimes?

1411
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,619
Is there nights of passion in High Wycombe?

1412
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:09,539
Oh, for God's sakes, I don't text her back!

1413
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:10,979
Why not?

1414
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,459
You bloody moron!

1415
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:17,299
She's out there,
she likes you and she's alive!

1416
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,219
And do you have the first idea

1417
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,579
how lucky you are?!

1418
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:24,779
Yes, she's a lunatic, she's a criminal,
she's insanely dangerous.

1419
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:27,459
Trust you to fall for a sociopath!
Oh, married an assassin!

1420
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,900
But she's, you know...

1421
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,680
- What?
- Just text

1422
01:19:31,705 --> 01:19:32,700
- her back.
- Why?

1423
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,619
Because High Wycombe is better than

1424
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:37,339
you are currently equipped to understand!

1425
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,579
I once caught a triple
poisoner in High Wycombe.

1426
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,379
That's only the beginning, mate.

1427
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,859
As I think I have explained
to you many times before,

1428
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:46,659
romantic entanglement,
while fulfilling for other people...

1429
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:49,379
- Would complete you as a human being.
- That doesn't even mean anything.

1430
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,579
Just text her, phone her,

1431
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,339
do something while
there's still a chance,

1432
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,099
because that chance doesn't last forever.

1433
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,379
Trust me, Sherlock,
it's gone before you know it.

1434
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,084
Before you know it!

1435
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,659
She was wrong about me.

1436
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:07,700
Mary? How so?

1437
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,339
She thought that if you
put yourself in harm's way,

1438
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,339
I'd... I'd rescue you, or something.

1439
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,500
But I didn't, not till she told me to.

1440
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,019
And that's how this works,
that's what you're missing.

1441
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:23,539
She taught me to be the man
she already thought I was.

1442
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:24,899
Get yourself a piece of that.

1443
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,019
Forgive me, but you are
doing yourself a disservice.

1444
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:29,499
I have known many people in this world,
but made few friends,

1445
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,580
and I can safely say... I cheated on her.

1446
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:36,339
No clever comeback?

1447
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:37,660
I cheated on you, Mary.

1448
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,899
There was a woman on the bus,

1449
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,899
and I had a plastic daisy in my hair,

1450
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,380
I'd been playing with Rosie.

1451
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,780
And this girl just smiled at me.

1452
01:20:51,326 --> 01:20:52,966
That's all it was, it was a smile.

1453
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,139
We texted, constantly.

1454
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:57,299
You want to know when?

1455
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,339
Every time you left the room, that's when.

1456
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,139
When you were feeding our daughter.

1457
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,980
When you were stopping her
from crying, that's when.

1458
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,700
And that's all it was.

1459
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,300
Just texting.

1460
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,700
But I wanted more.

1461
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,020
And do you know something? I still do.

1462
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,859
I'm not the man you thought I was,
I'm not that guy.

1463
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,379
I never could be.

1464
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,700
But that's the point.

1465
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:31,489
That's the whole point.

1466
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,860
Who you thought I was...

1467
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,700
...is the man who I want to be.

1468
01:21:44,014 --> 01:21:45,054
Well, then...

1469
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:48,820
...John Watson...

1470
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:56,517
...get the hell on with it.

1471
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:17,620
- It's OK.
- It's not OK.

1472
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:20,842
No...

1473
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,300
...but it is what it is.

1474
01:22:32,241 --> 01:22:35,539
So, Molly's going to meet
us at this cake place.

1475
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:38,059
Well, it's your birthday.
Cake is obligatory.

1476
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:41,299
Oh, well, I suppose a sugar
high is some sort of substitute.

1477
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,699
Behave.

1478
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,539
Right then.
You know, it's not my place to say,

1479
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:48,420
but... it was just texting.

1480
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:54,819
People text. Even I text.
Her, I mean. Woman. Bad idea.

1481
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,900
Try not to, but, you know, sometimes...

1482
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,299
It's not a pleasant thought, John,

1483
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,619
but I have this terrible
feeling from time to time

1484
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:05,019
that we might all just be human.

1485
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,740
- Even you?
- No.

1486
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:09,220
Even you.

1487
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:16,459
- Cake?
- Cake! Oh, um...

1488
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,619
What? What is it?

1489
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:19,660
What's wrong?

1490
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,779
Seriously?

1491
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,580
I'm Sherlock Holmes, I wear the damn hat!

1492
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,060
Isn't that right, Mary?

1493
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:43,019
You seem so much better, John.

1494
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:46,179
Yeah, I... I am. I think I am.

1495
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:49,699
Not all day, not every
day, but, you know.

1496
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,883
- It is what it is?
- Yeah.

1497
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:54,939
And Rosie?

1498
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,419
Beautiful, perfect.

1499
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,699
Unprecedented in the history of children.

1500
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:02,579
That's not my bias,
that's scientific fact.

1501
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:05,459
- Good. And Sherlock Holmes?
- Back to normal.

1502
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,619
'Get out!'

1503
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:07,939
She's possessed by the devil!

1504
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,939
I swear, my wife is channelling Satan!

1505
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,659
Yes, boring, go away!

1506
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,499
I'm not channelling Satan!

1507
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,620
Why not, given your
immediately alternative?

1508
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,339
- What about his brother?
- Mycroft? He's fine.

1509
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:31,139
So, you're off now.
I won't see you for a week?

1510
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:35,380
Just spending it at home.
Unless she calls. The PM.

1511
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,379
Here. What's this?

1512
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:41,939
- My number.
- I already have your number.

1513
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,659
- My private number.
- Why would I need that?

1514
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:48,099
I don't know. Maybe
you'd like a drink sometime.

1515
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:52,099
- Of... what?
- Up to you.

1516
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,780
Call me.

1517
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:08,019
I mean, obviously, "normal" and "fine"

1518
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,699
are both relative terms when it
comes to Sherlock and Mycroft.

1519
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,540
Obviously.

1520
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,700
She was real.

1521
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,699
'But I didn't mean Mycroft.'

1522
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,899
I meant the other one.

1523
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,819
Which other one? You know, the secret one.

1524
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:39,539
Oh, that was just something I said.

1525
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:40,700
I'm sure there's...

1526
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:47,059
How did you know about that?
I didn't tell you that.

1527
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,219
- You must have done.
- I really didn't.

1528
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,939
Well, maybe Sherlock told me.

1529
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:55,939
But you've met Sherlock
exactly once, in this room,

1530
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:57,259
he was off his head.

1531
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:00,179
Oh, no, no, I met him before that.

1532
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,499
When?

1533
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:05,419
We spent a night together. It was lovely.

1534
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,220
We had chips.

1535
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:15,900
"You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes."

1536
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:20,683
"You're... nicer."

1537
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,579
Culverton gave me Faith's original note.

1538
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,257
A mutual friend put us in touch.

1539
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:42,539
Did Sherlock ever
tell you about the note?

1540
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:45,219
I added some deductions for Sherlock.

1541
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,678
He was quite good.

1542
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:52,365
But... he didn't get the big one.

1543
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:08,699
In fairness, though, he does
have excellent taste in chips.

1544
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:10,259
- What's that?
- What's what?

1545
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,259
The flower in your hair,
it's like I had on the bus.

1546
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,859
You looked very sweet.

1547
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:16,100
But then...

1548
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,539
"You have such nice eyes."

1549
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:24,859
Amazing the times a man doesn't
really look at your face.

1550
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:29,299
Oh, you can hide behind a
sexy smile or a walking cane,

1551
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,419
or just be a therapist,

1552
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:35,939
talking about you... all the time.

1553
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,459
Oh, please don't go anywhere,

1554
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,459
I'm sure the therapist
who actually lives here

1555
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,979
wouldn't want blood on the carpet.

1556
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:43,019
Oh, hang on, it's fine.

1557
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,779
She's in a sack in the airing cupboard.

1558
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,980
- Who are you?
- Isn't it obvious?

1559
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,179
Haven't you guessed?

1560
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,579
I'm Eurus.

1561
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,019
Eurus?

1562
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:58,619
Silly name, isn't it? Greek.
Means "the east wind".

1563
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:00,859
My parents loved silly names,

1564
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:03,379
like Eurus...

1565
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:05,619
or Mycroft...

1566
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:07,666
or Sherlock.

1567
01:28:07,691 --> 01:28:09,459
Oh, look at him.

1568
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,619
Didn't it ever occur
to you, not even once,

1569
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:15,700
that Sherlock's secret brother might
just be Sherlock's secret sister?

1570
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,580
Huh?

1571
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,620
He's making a funny face.

1572
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,300
I think I'll put a hole in it.
